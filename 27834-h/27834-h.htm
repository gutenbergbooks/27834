<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">PAUL CAMERON HAS AN INSPIRATION</h3>


<p>It was the vision of a monthly paper for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span>
Burmingham High School that first turned Paul
Cameron's attention toward a printing press.</p>

<p>"Dad, how much does a printing press
cost?" he inquired one evening as he sat down
to dinner.</p>

<p>"A <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"A printing press."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron glanced up quizzically from
the roast he was carving.</p>

<p>"Aren't you a trifle ambitious?"</p>

<p>Paul laughed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," he admitted. "But I have
often heard you say, 'Nothing venture, nothing
have.'"</p>

<p>It was his father's turn to laugh.</p>

<p>"Yet why does your fancy take its flight
toward a printing press?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Eagerly Paul bent forward.</p>

<p>"Why you see, sir," he explained, "ever
since I was chosen President of '20 I've wanted
my class to be the finest the Burmingham High
ever graduated. I want it to leave a record
behind it, and do things no other class ever has.
There has never been a school paper. They
have them in other places. Why shouldn't
we?"</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron was all attention now.</p>

<p>"We've plenty of talent," went on Paul with
enthusiasm. "Even Mr. Calder, who is at the
head of the English department, asserts that.
Dick Rogers has had a poem printed in the town
paper&mdash;"</p>

<p>He saw a twinkle light his father's eye.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd just call it a verse," the boy
smiled apologetically, "but up at school we call
it a poem. It was about the war. And Eva
Hardy has had an essay published somewhere
and got two dollars for it."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"Besides, there is lots of stuff about the football
and hockey teams that we want to print&mdash;accounts
of the games, and notices of the
matches to be played. And the girls want to
boom their Red Cross work and the fair they
are going to have. There'd be plenty of material."</p>

<p>"Enough to fill a good-sized daily, I should
think," remarked Mr. Cameron, chuckling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul took the joke good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"How do people run a paper anyhow?" he
questioned presently. "Do printing presses
cost much? And where do you get them?
And do you suppose we fellows could run one
if we had it?"</p>

<p>His father leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"A fine printing press is a very intricate and
expensive piece of property, my son," he replied.
"It would take several hundred dollars
to equip a plant that would do creditable work.
The preparation of copy and the task of getting
it out would also take a great deal of time.
Considering the work you already have to do,
I should not advise you to annex a printer's
job to your other duties."</p>

<p>He saw the lad's face cloud.</p>

<p>"The better way to go at such an undertaking,"
he hastened to add, "would be to have
your publication printed by some established
press."</p>

<p>"Could we do it that way?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Mr. Cameron nodded. "There
are always firms that are glad to get extra work
if paid satisfactorily for it."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"The pay is just the rub," Paul confessed
frankly. "You see we haven't any class treasury
to draw on; at least we have one, but
there's nothing in it."</p>

<p>The two exchanged a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you would plan to take subscriptions,"
said the elder man. "Surely you are not going
to give your literary efforts away free of
charge."</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o," came slowly from Paul. Then
he continued more positively. "Oh, of course
we should try to make what we wrote worth selling.
We'd make people pay for it. But we
couldn't charge much. Most of us have been
paying for our Liberty Bonds and haven't a
great deal to spare. I know I haven't."</p>

<p>"About what price do you think you could
get for a school paper?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I haven't thought much
about it. Perhaps a dollar, or a dollar and a
quarter a year. Not more than that."</p>

<p>"And how many members would be likely to
take it?"</p>

<p>Paul meditated.</p>

<p>"There are about fifty seniors," he said.
"But of course the other three classes would
subscribe&mdash;at least some of them would. We
shouldn't confine the thing simply to the doings
of the seniors. We should put in not only general
school news but items about the lower
classes as well so that the paper would interest
everybody. It ought to bring us in quite a little
money. Shouldn't you think we could buy a
press and run it for two hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>"Have you considered the price of paper and
of ink, son?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; but they can't cost much," was the sanguine
response.</p>

<p>"Alas, they not only <i>can</i> but <i>do</i>," replied his
father.</p>

<p>"Then you think we couldn't have a school
paper."</p>

<p>"I did not say that."</p>

<p>"Well, you mean we couldn't make it pay."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't go so far as that, either," returned
Mr. Cameron kindly. "What I mean
is that you could not buy a printing press and
operate it with the money you would probably
have at hand. Nevertheless there are, as I
said before, other ways of getting at the matter.
If I were in your place I should look them up
before I abandoned the project."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Make sure of your proposition. Find out
how many of your schoolmates would pledge
themselves to subscribe to a paper if you had
one. Then, when you have made a rough estimate
of about how much money you would be
likely to secure, go and see some printer and
put the question up to him. Tell him what you
would want and find out exactly what he could
do for you. You've always been in a hurry to
leave school and take up business. Here is a
business proposition right now. Try your
hand at it and see how you like it."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron pushed back his chair, rose,
and sauntered into his den; and Paul, familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
with his father's habits, did not follow him, for
he knew that from now until late into the evening
the elder man would be occupied with law
books and papers.</p>

<p>Therefore the lad strolled out into the yard.
His studying was done; and even if it had not
been he was in no frame of mind to attack it
to-night. A myriad of schemes and problems
occupied his thought. Slowly he turned into
the walk and presently he found himself in the
street.</p>

<p>It was a still October twilight,&mdash;so still that
one could hear the rustle of the dry leaves as
they dropped from the trees and blew idly along
the sidewalk. There was a tang of smoke in
the air, and a blue haze from smoldering bonfires
veiled the fall atmosphere.</p>

<p>Aimlessly Paul lingered. No one was in
sight. Then the metallic shrillness of a bicycle
bell broke the silence. He wheeled about.
Noiselessly threading his way down the village
highway came a thick-set, rosy-faced boy of
sixteen or seventeen years of age.</p>

<p>"Hi, Carter!" called Paul. "Hold on! I
want to see you."</p>

<p>Carter grinned; stopping his wheel by rising
erect on its pedals, he vaulted to the ground.</p>

<p>"What's up, Paul?"</p>

<p>Without introduction Paul plunged into his
subject. He spoke earnestly and with boyish
eloquence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, Cart, what do you think of '20 starting
a school paper?"</p>

<p>"A paper! Great hat, Kipper&mdash;what for?"</p>

<p>Kipper was Paul's nickname.</p>

<p>"Why, to read, man."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk of reading," was Melville
Carter's spirited retort. "Aren't we all red-eyed
already with Latin and Roman history?
Why add a paper to our troubles?"</p>

<p>Paul did not reply.</p>

<p>"What do you want with a paper, Kipper?"
persisted Melville.</p>

<p>"Why to print our life histories and obituaries
in," he answered. "To extol our friends
and damn our enemies."</p>

<p>Carter laughed.</p>

<p>"Come off," returned he, affectionately
knocking Paul's hat down over his eyes.</p>

<p>"Stop your kidding, Cart. I'm serious."</p>

<p>"You really want a newspaper, Kip? <i>Another
newspaper!</i> Scott! I don't. I never
read the ones there are already."</p>

<p>"I don't mean a newspaper, Cart," explained
Paul with a touch of irritation. "I mean a
zippy little monthly with all the school news in
it&mdash;hockey, football, class meetings, and all the
things we'd like to read. Not highbrow stuff."</p>

<p>"Oh! I get you, Kipper," replied young Carter,
a gleam of interest dawning in his face.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be half bad. A school paper!"
he paused thoughtfully. "But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
money, Kip&mdash;the money to back such a
scheme? What about that?"</p>

<p>"We could take subscriptions."</p>

<p>"At how much a subscrip, oh promoter?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Paul responded vaguely.
"One&mdash;twenty-five per&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Per&mdash;<i>haps</i>," cut in Melville, "and perhaps
not. Who do you think, Kipper, is going to
pay a perfectly good dollar and a quarter for
the privilege of seeing his name in print and
reading all the things he knew before?"</p>

<p>In spite of himself Paul chuckled.</p>

<p>"Maybe they wouldn't know them before."</p>

<p>"Football and hockey! Nix! Don't they
all go to the games?"</p>

<p>"Not always. Besides, we'd put other
things in&mdash;grinds on the Freshies&mdash;all sorts
of stuff."</p>

<p>"I say! That wouldn't be so worse, would
it?" declared Melville with appreciation.</p>

<p>He looked down and began to dig a hole in
the earth with the toe of his much worn
sneaker.</p>

<p>"Your idea is all right, Kip&mdash;corking," he
asserted at length. "But the ducats&mdash;where
would those come from? It would cost a pile
to print a paper."</p>

<p>"I suppose we couldn't buy a press second-hand
and do our own printing," ruminated
Paul.</p>

<p>"Buy a press!" shouted Carter, breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
into a guffaw. "You are a green one, Kip, even
if you are class president. Why, man alive, a
printing press that's any good costs a small fortune&mdash;more
money than the whole High
School has, all put together. I know what
presses cost because my father is in the publishing
business."</p>

<p>Paul sighed.</p>

<p>"That's about what my dad said," he affirmed
reluctantly. "He suggested we get
someone to print the paper for us."</p>

<p>"Oh, we could do that all right if we had the
spondulics."</p>

<p>"The subscriptions would net us quite a
sum."</p>

<p>"How much could we bank on?"</p>

<p>"I've no idea," Paul murmured.</p>

<p>"I'll bet I could nail most of the Juniors.
I'd simply stand them up against the wall and
tell them it was their money or their life&mdash;death
or a subscription to the&mdash;what are you
going to call this rich and rare newspaper?" he
inquired, suddenly breaking off in the midst of
his harangue and turning to his companion.</p>

<p>"I hadn't got as far as that," answered Paul
blankly.</p>

<p>"But you've got to get a name, you know,"
Melville declared. "You can't expect to boom
something so hazy that it isn't called anything
at all. <i>Don't you want to take our class paper</i>
won't draw the crowd. You've got to start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
with a slogan&mdash;something spectacular and
thrilling. <i>Buy the Nutcracker!</i> <i>Subscribe to
the Fire-eater!</i> <i>Have a copy of the Jabberwock!</i>
For goodness sake, christen it something!
Start out with a punch or you'll never
get anywhere. Why not call it <i>The March
Hare</i>? That's wild and crazy enough to suit
anybody. Then you can publish any old trash
in it that you chose. They've brought it on
themselves if they stand for such a title."</p>

<p>Paul clapped a hand on his friend's shoulder.</p>

<p><a name="q010" id="q010"></a>"<i>The March Hare!</i>" he repeated with enthusiasm.
"You've hit it, Cart! <i>The March
Hare</i> it is! We'll begin getting subscriptions
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't want to issue a sample copy
first, would you?" Melville suggested.</p>

<p>"No, siree! That'll be the fun. They
must go it blind. We'll make the whole thing
as spooky and mysterious as we can. Nobody
shall know what he is going to eat. It will be
twice the sport."</p>

<p>"But suppose after you've collected all your
money you find you can't get any one to print
the paper?"</p>

<p>"We'll have to take a chance," replied Paul
instantly. "If worst comes to worst we can
give the money back again. But I shan't figure
on doing that. We'll win out, Cart; don't
you worry."</p>

<p>"Bully for you, old man! You sure are a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>sport. Nothing like selling something that
doesn't even exist! I see you years hence on
Wall Street, peddling nebulous gold mines and
watered stocks."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, can't you!" laughed Paul
good-naturedly. "Quit your joshing! I'm serious.
You've got to help me, too. You
must start in landing subscriptions to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I! I go around rooting for your <i>March
Hare</i> when I know that not a line of it has seen
printer's ink!" sniffed Melville.</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>Melville grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, you have a nerve!" he affirmed.</p>

<p>"You're going to do it just the same, Cart."</p>

<p>There was a compelling, magnetic quality in
Paul Cameron which had won for him his leadership
at school; it came to his aid in the present instance.</p>

<p>Melville looked for a second into his chum's
face and then smiled.</p>

<p>"All right," he answered. "I'm with you,
Kipper. We'll see what we can do toward
fooling the public."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to fool them," Paul retorted.
"I'm in dead earnest. I mean to get out a good
school paper that shall be worth the money
people pay for it. There shall be no fake
about it. To-morrow I shall call a class meeting
and we'll elect an editorial staff&mdash;editor-in-chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
publicity committee, board of managers,
and all the proper dignitaries. Then
we'll get right down to work."</p>

<p>Melville regarded his friend with undisguised
admiration.</p>

<p>"You'll make it a go, Kip!" he cried. "I
feel it in my bones now. Hurrah for the
<i>March Hare</i>! I can hear the shekels chinking
into our pockets this minute. Put me down
for the first subscription. I'll break the ginger-ale
bottle over the treasury."</p>

<p>"Shall it be a dollar, a dollar and a quarter,
or an out and out one-fifty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, put it at one-fifty. We're all millionaires
and we may as well go in big while we're
at it. What is one-fifty for such a ream of wisdom
as we're going to get for our money?"</p>

<p>Melville vaulted into his bicycle saddle.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm off, Kipper," he called over his
shoulder. "Got to do some errands for the
Mater. So long!"</p>

<p>"I can depend on you, Cart?"</p>

<p>"Sure you can. I'll shout for your <i>March
Hare</i> with all my lungs. I'm quite keen about
it already."</p>

<p>Paul watched him speed through the gathering
shadows and disappear round the turn in
the road. Then, straightening his shoulders
with resolution, he went into the house to seek
his pillow and dream dreams of the <i>March
Hare</i>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE CLASS MEETING AND WHAT FOLLOWED IT</h3>


<p>The following day at recess, after a noisy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
clamor of conversation and laughter, the class
meeting came to order.</p>

<p>"I have called you together to-day," began
Paul Cameron from the platform, "to lay before
1920 a new undertaking. I am sure there
is not one of you who does not want to make
our class a unique and illustrious one. The
Burmingham High School has never had a paper.
1920 has the great opportunity to give it
one and to go down to history as its founder."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"The big dailies do not appreciate us. They
never write us up. Why should we not write
ourselves up&mdash;chronicle our doings, that such
noteworthy deeds may never be forgotten?"</p>

<p>A ripple of laughter greeted the interrogation.</p>

<p>Paul saw his advantage and went on. He
painted in glowing terms his dream of the
<i>March Hare</i>. Every instant the interest and
enthusiasm of his audience increased. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a storm of clapping broke in upon his words but
he raised his hand and the noise ceased.
Quietly he closed his modest speech with the
suggestion that a managing board be appointed
to put the project into operation, if such were
the pleasure of the meeting. Before he could
seat himself a dozen boys were on their feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. President!" shouted Melville Carter.</p>

<p>"Mr. President!" came at the same moment
from Donald Hall.</p>

<p>"Mr. President! Mr. President!" The
cry rang from every corner of the room.</p>

<p>Paul listened to each speaker in turn.</p>

<p>1920 was not only unanimous but insistent
upon the new venture.</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell it Paul himself
was elected editor-in-chief, an editorial
staff had been appointed, Melville Carter was
voted in as business manager, and Billie Ransome
as publicity agent. Nor did 1920's fervor
end there. Before the meeting adjourned
every person in the class had not only pledged
himself to subscribe to the <i>March Hare</i> but had
promised to get one or more outside subscriptions.</p>

<p>Paul, descending from the speaker's desk,
was the center of an admiring and eager group
of students.</p>

<p>"I say, Kip, where are you going to get the
paper printed?" questioned Donald Hall.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," replied Paul jauntily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll have to see how much money we are
going to have."</p>

<p>"Why don't you get Mel Carter's father to
do it? He publishes the <i>Echo</i>, and Mel is our
business manager. That ought to give us some
pull."</p>

<p>Paul started.</p>

<p>"I never thought of asking Mr. Carter," he
returned slowly. "I don't believe Melville did,
either. He's kind of a grouch. Still, he
couldn't do more than refuse. Of course the
<i>Echo</i> is pretty highbrow. Mr. Carter might
feel we were beneath his notice."</p>

<p>"No matter," was Donald's cheerful answer.
"I guess we could live through it if he did sit
on us. Besides, maybe he wouldn't. Perhaps
he'd enjoy fostering young genius. You said
you were going to make the paper worth while
and something more than an athletic journal."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," retorted Paul promptly.
"We've got to make it tally up with what the
subscribers pay for it. I mean to put in
politics, poetry, philosophy, and every other
sort of dope," he concluded with a smile.</p>

<p>"You certainly are the one and only great
editor-in-chief!" chuckled Donald. Then he
added hastily: "There's Melville now. Why
don't you buttonhole him about his father?"</p>

<p>"I will," cried Paul, hurrying across the corridor
to waylay his chum.</p>

<p>"Hi, Cart!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Melville came to a stop.</p>

<p>"Say, what's the matter with your father
printing the <i>March Hare</i> for us?"</p>

<p>"What!" The lad was almost speechless
with astonishment.</p>

<p>"I say," repeated Paul earnestly, "what's
the matter with your father printing the <i>March
Hare</i>? He prints the <i>Echo</i>. Don't you believe
he'd print our paper too?"</p>

<p>Melville was plainly disconcerted.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know," he managed to stammer
uneasily. "You see, the <i>Echo</i> office is
such a darn busy place. My father is driven
most to death. Besides, we couldn't pay much.
It wouldn't be worth the bother to the <i>Echo</i>."</p>

<p>"Maybe not," said Paul. "But don't you
think if your father knew we were trying to run
a decent paper he might like to help us out?
Who knows but some of us may become distinguished
journalists when we grow up?
There may be real geniuses in our midst&mdash;celebrities."</p>

<p>"Great Scott, Paul, but you have got a wily
tongue! You've kissed the Blarney Stone if
ever man has!"</p>

<p>But Paul was not to be cajoled from his purpose.</p>

<p>"Won't you put it up to your Pater when you
go home, Cart?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> ask him!" exclaimed Melville, drawing
back a step or two. "I couldn't, Kip. Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
put me in such a hole. I wouldn't dare.
Straight goods, I wouldn't. You don't know
my dad. Why, he wouldn't even hear me out.
He'd say at the outset that it was all rot and
that he couldn't be bothered with such a
scheme."</p>

<p>"You absolutely refuse to ask him?"</p>

<p>Melville turned a wretched face toward Paul.</p>

<p>"I'd do most anything for you, Kip," he said
miserably. "You know that. But I couldn't
ask favors of my father for you or anybody
else. He isn't like other people. I'd go to
any one else in a minute. But Father's so&mdash;well,
it would just take more nerve than I've
got. He's all right, though. Don't think he
isn't. It's only that he's pretty stiff. I'm
afraid of him; straight goods, I am."</p>

<p>Paul nodded.</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>

<p>"Would you have any objection to somebody
else going to him?"</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Not the least in the world," Melville declared.
"I don't see why you shouldn't if you
want to take a chance. You'll have no luck,
though."</p>

<p>"He couldn't any more than kick me out."</p>

<p>"He'll do that all right!" Melville exclaimed,
with a grin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"What if he does?" asked the editor-in-chief
with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't mind being turned down
and swept out of the office before your mouth
is fairly open, go ahead."</p>

<p>"I shan't go to the office," responded Paul
deliberately. "I shall go around to the house."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know why&mdash;only it makes
Father as mad as hops to be disturbed about
business after he gets home."</p>

<p>"I'm not supposed to know that, am I?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o."</p>

<p>"Then I shall come to the house," reiterated
Paul firmly. "Your father will have more
leisure there and I think he will be more likely
to listen."</p>

<p>"He won't listen to you anywhere."</p>

<p>"We'll see whether he will or not," said
Paul. "At least I can make my try and convince
myself."</p>

<p>"It'll be no use, Kip," persisted Melville.
"I hate to have you disappointed, old chap."</p>

<p>"I shan't be disappointed," said Paul kindly.
"I shan't allow myself to expect much. Even
if your father does turn me down he may give
me a useful pointer or two."</p>

<p>"He won't do anything for you," Melville asserted
dubiously. "He'll just have nothing to
do with it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of Paul's optimism he was more than
half of Melville's opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was well known throughout
Burmingham as a stern, austere man whom
people feared rather than loved. He had the
reputation of being shrewd, close-fisted, and
sharp at a bargain,&mdash;a person of few friends
and many enemies. He was a great fighter,
carrying a grudge to any length for the sheer
pleasure of gratifying it. Therefore many a
more mature and courageous promoter than
Paul Cameron had shrunk from approaching
him with a business proposition.</p>

<p>Even Paul did not at all relish the mission before
him; he was, however, too manly to shirk
it. Hence that evening, directly after dinner,
he made his way to the mansion of Mr. Arthur
Presby Carter, the wealthy owner of the <i>Echo</i>,
Burmingham's most widely circulated daily.</p>

<p>Fortunately or unfortunately&mdash;Paul was
uncertain which&mdash;the capitalist was at home
and at leisure; and with beating heart the boy
was ushered into the presence of this illustrious
gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter greeted him politely but with no
cordiality.</p>

<p>"So you're Paul Cameron. I've had dealings
with your father," he remarked dryly.
"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Paul's courage ebbed. The question was
crisp and direct, demanding a reply of similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
tenor. With a gulp of apprehension the lad
struggled to make an auspicious opening for
his subject; but no words came to his tongue.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you brought a message from your
father," suggested the great man, after he had
waited impatiently for an interval.</p>

<p>"No, sir. Father didn't know that I was
coming," Paul contrived to stammer. "I came
on my own account. I wanted to know if you
wouldn't like to print the <i>March Hare</i>, a new
monthly publication that is soon coming out."</p>

<p>"The <i>March Hare</i>!" repeated Mr. Carter incredulously.</p>

<p>Paul nodded silently.</p>

<p>"Did I hear aright?" inquired Mr. Carter
majestically. "Did you say the <i>March
Hare</i>?"</p>

<p>The title took on a ludicrous incongruity as
it fell from his lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," gasped Paul. "We are going to
get out a High School paper and call it the
<i>March Hare</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Carter made no comment. He seemed
too stunned with amazement to do so.</p>

<p>"We want to make it a really good paper,"
went on Paul desperately. "The school has
never had a paper before, but I don't see why
it shouldn't. We're all studying English and
writing compositions. Why shouldn't we
write something for publication?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a note of sarcasm, or was it ridicule,
in the words, that put Paul on his mettle.</p>

<p>"We intend to make it a good, dignified magazine,"
he went on quickly. "We plan to have
the school news and some more serious articles
in it. We've got a managing board, and an
editorial staff, and all the things papers have."</p>

<p>"And why do you come to me?"</p>

<p>"Because we need a printer."</p>

<p>"You wish me to print this remarkable document?"</p>

<p>Paul smiled ingenuously. "Yes, sir." There
was a silence. Mr. Carter seemed too dumfounded
to speak.</p>

<p>"You see," went on the boy, "getting out a
paper would give us fellows some business experience
and at the same time some practice in
writing. I believe we could make the thing
pay, too."</p>

<p>"How many subscribers have you?"</p>

<p>"I had two last night&mdash;myself and another
boy," Paul replied. "But to-day I have a
hundred and fifty; by to-morrow I expect to
add about two hundred more."</p>

<p>"Your circulation increases rapidly," remarked
Mr. Carter, the shadow of a smile on
his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it does," came innocently from
Paul.</p>

<p>"How many numbers would you wish to issue
annually?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ten. We'd want to bring out a paper
the first of each month from October to June.
With our studies, that would be about all we
could handle, I guess."</p>

<p>"I guess so, too," agreed Mr. Carter caustically.</p>

<p>"How large a paper do you plan to have?"
he added an instant later.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hadn't thought much about that. It
would depend on how much space we could fill
up. Perhaps twenty-five pages."</p>

<p>The magnate nodded.</p>

<p>It was impossible to fathom what was going
on in his mind. Was he preparing to burst
into a tirade of ridicule, or was he really considering
the proposition?</p>

<p>"We'd want some good sort of a cover, of
course," Paul put in as an afterthought.</p>

<p>"In colors, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And nice paper and clear print."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Paul, not noting the increasing
sarcasm in the man's voice.</p>

<p>"How much would you charge for an annual
subscription?"</p>

<p>"A dollar and a half."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what it would cost to
get out a paper such as you propose?" There
was a ring of contempt in the words.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, it would cost a good deal more money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
than you have to offer, young man." With a
cruel satisfaction he saw the boy's face fall.</p>

<p>"Then that's the end of it, I guess, so far as
your firm is concerned," replied Paul, turning
toward the door. "I'll have to take my proposition
somewhere else."</p>

<p>Something in the boy's proud bearing appealed
to the man. It had not dawned on him
until now that the lad actually considered the
proposal a strictly business one. He had
thought that he came to wheedle and beg, and
Mr. Carter detested having favors asked of him.
Calling Paul back, he motioned him to sit down.</p>

<p>"I'm not ready to wind up this matter quite
so quickly," he observed. "Let us talk the
thing over a little more fully. Suppose I were
to make you a proposition."</p>

<p>Leaning forward, he took a cigar from the
library table and, lighting it, puffed a series of
rings into the air.</p>

<p>"There are certain things that I want to do
in Burmingham," he announced in leisurely
fashion. There was a twinkle of humor beneath
the shaggy brows. "Your father, for
example, doesn't take the <i>Echo</i>. He has none
too cordial feeling toward me personally, and in
addition he says my paper is too conservative.
Then there are firms that I can't get to advertise
with us&mdash;business houses in the town that
are not represented on our pages. And lastly,
Judge Damon has constantly refused to do a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
set of political articles for me. Put those deals
through for me, and I'll print your <i>March
Hare</i>."</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, regarding Paul
with a provoking smile.</p>

<p>"But how can I?" gasped Paul, bewildered.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"That's up to you," he said. "Sometimes
fools rush in where angels fear to tread. Your
father, for instance, will certainly want this
venture of yours to succeed. Tell him that if
he takes the <i>Echo</i> instead of the <i>Mirror</i>, or in
addition to it, it will be a big help to you."</p>

<p>"But my father&mdash;" burst out Paul, then
stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"I know he doesn't like me," put in Mr. Carter
calmly. "We differ in politics and we've
had one bad set-to on the subject. He won't
take my paper&mdash;wouldn't do it for love or
money. I know perfectly well how he feels."</p>

<p>"So that's why you want to make him do
it?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind, sonny. I want you to get
him to. That's enough," was the curt retort.</p>

<p>Paul flushed.</p>

<p>"And with regard to the advertising I mentioned,"
continued Mr. Carter, "I am sure you
can easily carry that through. The Kimball
and Dalrymple boys are in your class, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell them the <i>Echo</i> wants an ad. from the
firm of George L. Kimball and from Dalrymple
and Company."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"As for Judge Damon&mdash;well, if you can't
manage the judge, I can't tell you how to do it.
All is, I want six articles on The League of
Nations. He's an authority on international
law and the best man I know to handle the subject.
He hasn't, however, much more use for
me than your father has, and thus far has
politely refused every offer I've made him."</p>

<p>"Carl Damon is on our <i>March Hare</i> literary
staff," ventured Paul.</p>

<p>"There you are!" declared Mr. Carter
triumphantly. "Set him at his father's heels
and tell him to bring me the six articles I'm
after. Then you boys flax round and get me
ten new firms to advertise in the <i>Echo</i> and I'll
sign a contract with you to print your <i>March
Hare</i> in good shape."</p>

<p>The lips of the elder man curled humorously.</p>

<p>Paul rose.</p>

<p>"It's mighty good of you, sir," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Don't thank me, youngster, until you've
landed your bargain," protested Mr. Carter
with shame-faced haste. "Remember I said
that when you had fulfilled my conditions <i>then</i>
I would print your <i>March Hare</i>; I shan't do it
until then."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I am sure we can fulfill them."</p>

<p>"You seem very certain of it."</p>

<p>"I feel so."</p>

<p>"Humph! Have you ever tried to get an
ad?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Or asked your father why he didn't take
the <i>Echo</i>?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or tried to worm an article out of Judge
Damon?"</p>

<p>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p>"Then you've some fun ahead of you," remarked
Mr. Carter, rising. "I'd wait to do
my crowing if I were you."</p>

<p>With a grim laugh and a gesture of farewell
he swept the boy from the room.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">MR. CAMERON TAKES A HAND IN THE GAME</h3>


<p>As Paul walked down the steps of the Carter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
mansion he felt, as did David Copperfield in the
presence of the waiter, very young indeed.
Had Mr. Carter simply been making game
of him? And was the business world actually
such a network of schemes and complexities?</p>

<p>And how did it happen that the printing of a
newspaper was such a difficult and expensive
undertaking? Why should it be?</p>

<p>Paper and ink were common enough commodities
surely. All that had to be done was
to print, and if a press were at hand it must be
the easiest thing in the world to do that. Why
did people make such a fuss over printing a
paper?</p>

<p>Thoughtfully he walked home and turned in
at his own door.</p>

<p>He was in a very sober frame of mind, unwontedly
sober for him; so sober, in fact, that
his father, whom he encountered in the hall,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Goodness me, son, you look as if your last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
friend on earth had perished. What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>The boy smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

<p>"But you'd never look like that if there
weren't. Come, tell me all about it. What's
the trouble?"</p>

<p>The gray eyes of the man regarded the lad
kindly.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm just thinking."</p>

<p>"About what, pray? Something pretty solemn,
I'll be bound," persisted his father.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've a lot of things on my mind," answered
Paul hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Suppose you give me a sample of one of
them."</p>

<p>"Just business," replied Paul.</p>

<p>As the words fell with familiar cadence, Mr.
Cameron laughed. How often he had met his
wife's troubled inquiries with the same retort.</p>

<p>"Business, eh! And how long is it since
the burdens of business have fallen on your
young shoulders?"</p>

<p>"Since yesterday."</p>

<p>"And already you are bowed to the earth
with worry?" commented his father playfully.
"Come, son, what's troubling you?"</p>

<p>"The school paper."</p>

<p>"Not going to be able to put it through?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not that," said Paul quickly. "We
are going to put it through all right, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
at this moment I don't exactly see how. I had
no idea it cost so much to get a paper printed."</p>

<p>"It isn't the actual printing, so much as the
typesetting and all that goes with it, that makes
printing an expensive job," explained Mr. Cameron.
"Just now, too, paper and ink cost a
great deal, and labor is high."</p>

<p>"Did people always have to pay so much for
paper?"</p>

<p>"People didn't always use to have paper,
my son."</p>

<p>Paul opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"What did they print on, then?"</p>

<p>"They didn't have printing presses, either,"
answered Mr. Cameron. "Long ago people
did not care so much for reading as we do now.
Most of them hadn't education enough to read
a book or a paper if they had had one. In fact,
many kings, bishops, and persons of rank could
neither read nor write. Charlemagne could
not sign his own name. The era before the
Renaissance was an age of unbelievable ignorance.
It is a marvel that with the turmoil of
war and the utter lack of interest in anything
intellectual any learning came out of the period."</p>

<p>"But aren't there very old writings in some
of the museums?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have manuscripts of very ancient
date," agreed his father. "Much of the matter
in them however&mdash;material such as the Norse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Sagas and the Odes of Horace&mdash;were handed
down by word of mouth and were not written
until long after they had been chanted or sung.
Poets and minstrels passed on their tales to
other bards; had they not done so, Homer, Ossian,
and the Sanscrit Vedas would have been
lost to us. A metric arrangement of the stories
was probably made to aid the singers in remembering
their subject matter. You know how
much easier it is to memorize something that
has a swing or rhythm?"</p>

<p>Paul nodded.</p>

<p>"That without question accounts for the
poetic form in which some of our oldest literature
has come down to us," Mr. Cameron said.
"Then, as good luck would have it, Roman and
Greek slaves were compelled to copy many of
the writings of the time on long rolls of vellum
or papyrus, and in that way more of the ancient
literature was preserved. There was only a
small reading public in either Rome or Greece,
and those who were interested in books could
secure what they wished through professional
scribes, or could listen to readings of the classics
from the portico of some rich nobleman
who had been fortunate enough to secure a copy
of some rare poem or play. Often, too, such
things were read in the baths, which in those
days took the place of our modern clubs."</p>

<p>"And that was the way we got our early
books?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. There were slaves whose duty it
was to do nothing but copy manuscripts for
their masters. They were given food, shelter,
and clothing in return for their labors. Of
course they were not an educated class of workers,
and in consequence they often made mistakes;
but they served to prevent the total destruction
of such classics as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cæsar's Commentaries, I suppose," interrupted
Paul mischievously.</p>

<p>"Cæsar's writings would have been a great
loss," declared his father good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"Not to me! Nor Cicero's either."</p>

<p>"But are they not all old and interesting as
a relic of history?"</p>

<p>"They are more interesting now that you
have told me something about them," admitted
Paul, with characteristic honesty.</p>

<p>"Oh, you would find many interesting and
even amusing incidents connected with these
early writings, were you to study into the matter,"
continued Mr. Cameron. "Fancy, for
example, a hand-written scroll of a book selling
for the equivalent of two cents in our money;
and fancy others not selling at all, and being
used by grocers to wrap up spices and pastries.
The modern author thinks he is paid little
enough. What, I wonder, would he say to
such treatment?"</p>

<p>Paul laughed.</p>

<p>"Even at a later date when the monks began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
copying and illuminating manuscripts there
was at first no great demand for them. Learning
was conceded to be the rightful possession
of the rich and powerful, and whether the kings
or nobles of the court could read or not, most
of the books were bought by them simply as art
works. Many, of course, especially the most
skillfully illuminated ones, were very beautiful
and were well worth owning."</p>

<p>"But think of the time it must have taken to
make them by hand!" speculated Paul.</p>

<p>"Time was no object in those days," smiled
his father. "There was nothing to hurry
about. A monk would toil at a single manuscript
day after day, month after month; sometimes
year after year. It must have been a
sleepy, tiresome business to write out even a
short manuscript so carefully, to say nothing of
a long one like the Bible. What wonder that
the patient workers were so glad when their
tedious task was done that they inscribed at
the end of it a little song of thanksgiving. I
remember seeing one old book in a European
museum at the end of which was written:</p>

<p>"<i>'This book was illuminated, bound, and
perfected by Henry Cremer, vicar of the Collegiate
Church of Saint Stephen in Metz, on
the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed
Virgin, in the year of our Lord 1456.</i></p>

<p>"<i>'Thanks be to God, Hallelujah!'</i></p>

<p>"No doubt the pious Henry Cremer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
thankful for many other things besides the
completion of his manuscript, but I am sure he
must have been human enough to draw a sigh
of relief when he put the last stroke to such a
tedious piece of work. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet he was," agreed Paul.</p>

<p>"Can't you see those patient monks alone in
their dimly lighted cells, silently writing day
after day?" continued Mr. Cameron. "Many
a poor fellow who drudged so mechanically at
his task copied the errors in the text quite as
faithfully as the rest of it. In consequence, it
at last became imperative to demand that the
scribes work with more intelligence, and therefore
at the end of a manuscript would be such
an admonition as this:</p>

<p>"<i>'I adjure thee who shall transcribe this
book by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by His glorious
coming to judge the quick and the dead,
that thou compare what thou transcribest and
correct it carefully according to the copy from
which thou transcribest, and that thou also annex
a copy of this adjuration to what thou hast
written.'</i></p>

<p>"Thus, you see, was the copyist forced to
study his text and pass the caution against mistakes
on to others. Nevertheless, solemn and
reverent as was this warning, it did not prevent
errors from slipping into the old illuminated
manuscripts, and many a one is marred by misspelling
or miswording."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't wonder it is," exclaimed Paul.
"Why, the very thought that I must not make
a mistake would cause me to make one. Besides,
I should get so sleepy after I had written
for hours that I should not know what I was
doing."</p>

<p>"Probably much of the time they didn't."</p>

<p>Paul thought a moment.</p>

<p>"I suppose, though, the monks were paid for
their hard work, so it was only fair for them to
be careful," he reflected.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied his father, "they
were not paid any more than were the slaves
whom the Greeks and Romans employed.
Their living was given them; that was all.
Often the books they made were very beautiful
and were sold to dignitaries of the Church or to
titled persons for great sums; but any monies
received from such a transaction went into the
coffers of the Church and not into the monks'
pockets. The Church however, in return, provided
them with all they needed so they did not
go entirely unrewarded. Some day when we
can find time we will go to the city and hunt up
some of these rare old manuscripts in the
museum. You would be interested to see how
exquisitely many of them are done. The initial
letter, or frequently the catch word, is painted
in color, and the borders are richly decorated
with intricate scroll-work."</p>

<p>"Did the monks have to design the pages as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
well as print them?" inquired Paul with surprise.</p>

<p>"The same monk did not always do all the
work," his father said. "Some merely inscribed
the text and illuminated the first letter
or word; afterward the sheets were handed to
some one else who designed the decoration and
sketched it in. Then it went to the colorist,
who in turn illuminated, or painted, the drawing.
You will find every inch of some of the
more ornate manuscripts filled in with designs.
The great objection to this method was that several
persons handled the work and therefore in
many cases the decoration had no relation
whatsoever to the text; in fact, frequently it
was entirely inappropriate to it."</p>

<p>Paul smiled.</p>

<p>"No more relation, I suppose, than the text
of our school paper will have to its name:
<i>March Hare</i>."</p>

<p>"Just about the same," conceded his father
with amusement. "So that's the title you've
selected for your monthly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. We couldn't seem to think of
anything better."</p>

<p>"It's not bad at all. How are you coming
with the project? You seem bothered."</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;a little."</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Haven't you money
enough to induce anybody to print your publication?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I have a printer," replied Paul confidently.
"The <i>Echo</i> is going to get it out for
us."</p>

<p>"The <i>Echo</i>!" Mr. Cameron regarded the
lad incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;how in the name of goodness
did you pull off a bargain like that?" demanded
the man. "The <i>Echo</i> of all people! Why, I
should as soon think of asking the government
to do it! Their rates are enormous and they
never take outside work. Are you quite sure
they have agreed to do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There's no mistake about it, Dad.
They were perfectly serious. They made a
few conditions, though."</p>

<p>"Whom did you see?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Carter."</p>

<p>"Carter! Mr. Carter himself? Mr. Arthur
Carter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"My soul and body!" murmured Mr. Cameron.
"I wouldn't have believed he'd see you.
You did have a nerve, son! Why, nobody ever
asks a favor of Carter. I wouldn't, for a thousand
dollars. It's a marvel he listened to you.
And he is actually going to print your paper?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;that is, under certain conditions."
Paul waited an instant, then added dryly: "In
fact, Dad, you're one of the conditions."</p>

<p>"I!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy chuckled.</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. He wants you to subscribe to the
<i>Echo</i>."</p>

<p>"He does, does he!" Mr. Cameron cried with
indignation. "The impertinence of the man!
Well, he can continue to want me to. When he
finds me doing it he will be years older than he
is now. What does he think? Does he expect
to turn me from a broad-minded Democrat
into a stand-pat Republican like himself? The
old fox! He just enjoyed sending me that
message, and by my own son, too. I ran
against him for Mayor in 1916 and lost the
fight because I wouldn't use the weapons he
did. You were a little chap then and so do not
remember much about it; but it was a nasty
business. Since that day we've never spoken.
Take his paper! I wouldn't so much as look at
it if he offered it to me free of charge on a silver
salver."</p>

<p>Paul regarded his father with consternation.</p>

<p>"But I say, Dad, if you don't help us out, it's
all up with the <i>March Hare</i>."</p>

<p>"I can't help that," blustered Mr. Cameron,
striding impatiently across the hall. "Why,
it's preposterous! He's making a goat of you,
son, that's all. He never meant to print your
paper. He simply made up a lot of conditions
that he knew could never be fulfilled and sent
you away with them. It was a mean trick.
Just like him, too! He'd think it a great joke."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe he was joking," Paul answered
slowly. "And anyway, even if he
were, I don't have to take it as a joke. I can
take him seriously, fulfill his contract, and make
him live up to his agreement, can't I? Then if
the whole thing were a joke, the joke would be
on him."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron gazed into the boy's eager face
a few seconds, then smiled suddenly.</p>

<p>"That's not a bad idea," he observed.
"We'd have Carter fast in his own trap then."</p>

<p>"To be sure."</p>

<p>"By Jove, Paul&mdash;if I haven't half a mind
to help you out!" He slapped his son on the
shoulder. "I'll do it! I declare if I won't.
I'll send in my subscription to the <i>Echo</i> to-morrow.
I needn't read the thing, even if I do
take it. What other tasks did the old schemer
impose on you?"</p>

<p>"I've got to get some ads for him&mdash;ten of
them."</p>

<p>"Whew!"</p>

<p>"And I've got to ask Judge Damon for six
articles on The League of Nations."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! That's a good one," chuckled Mr.
Cameron. "The League of Nations is like a
red rag to the Judge. He can't be trusted to
speak of it, let alone writing about it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Carter said Judge Damon was an expert
on international law," explained Paul.</p>

<p>"So he is, so he is! But he isn't expressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
his opinion of The League of Nations, just the
same."</p>

<p>"You think he wouldn't do the articles?"</p>

<p>"Do them? Mercy, no!"</p>

<p>"Then I guess it was all a joke," murmured
Paul, with a wistful, disappointed quiver of the
lip.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron saw the joyousness fade from
the young face.</p>

<p>"It was contemptible for him to put up such
a game on you kids!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>Thrusting his hands into his pockets he
stared up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," he presently remarked
slowly, "but what, if your uncle knew the circumstances,
he might be coaxed into meeting
Carter's demand."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>Again courage shone in Paul's eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure of it."</p>

<p>The lad's brow became radiant.</p>

<p>"I'll see Damon myself," went on Cameron
humorously. "I'll tell him I have yielded up
my preferences for the common good and that
he must do the same. His son Carl is in your
class, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then it's as much his duty to help on 1920
as mine. He adores that boy of his. You
leave him to me. I'll bring him round to our
way of thinking all right."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the ads?"</p>

<p>"Set your classmates on their fathers," was
the terse reply as the elder man clapped on his
hat and left the house.</p>

<p>Paul watched him out of sight, then sighed a
happy little sigh of satisfaction. With such a
sympathetic colleague to fall back upon he felt
confident the <i>March Hare</i> would succeed.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">ANOTHER ALLY</h3>


<p>Mr. Cameron was as good as his word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning when Paul appeared at
breakfast, he was greeted with the words:
"Well, I won Damon over. You're to go
around there this evening and he'll have a paper
ready for you to the effect that in consideration
of the <i>Echo</i> printing the <i>March Hare</i>, the
judge will write for the <i>Echo</i> six articles on the
pros and cons of The League of Nations. You
are to get Carter to sign this agreement and
then we'll lock it up in my strong box at the
bank."</p>

<p>"That's bully, Dad. It was mighty good of
you to take this trouble for us."</p>

<p>"That's all right, son. I'm always glad to
help you boys out. Besides," he added whimsically,
"I am not entirely philanthropic. The
thing amuses me. I always enjoy beating
Carter when I get the chance."</p>

<p>Paul regarded his father affectionately.
The big man seemed very human just at that
moment,&mdash;little more, in fact, than a boy like
himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, as I understand it, all we fellows
have to do now is to round up the ten ads.," he
said, dropping into his chair at the table and
vigorously attacking his grape-fruit.</p>

<p>"What ads. are you talking about, Paul?"
asked his mother, who had just entered the
room.</p>

<p>"Oh, we boys down at school want to get
some ads. to help publish our new paper."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron listened while the plans of the
<i>March Hare</i> were unfolded to her.</p>

<p>"Hill and Holden, the Garden Street grocers,
are going to put a new coffee on the market;
their man told me about it yesterday and
said they were going to advertise it very extensively."</p>

<p>"There's your chance, Paul!" cried Mr.
Cameron. "Call them up this minute and nail
them before they send the advertisement to the
papers. We're customers of theirs and without
doubt they'd just as soon send their announcement
to the <i>Echo</i> through you. Tell
them they will be doing a service to the High
School pupils, most of whose families' names
are on their books."</p>

<p>Paul needed no second bidding. He sprang
to the telephone. A few instants later he re-entered
the room with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"O. K.!" he said. "I talked with one of the
firm who said they would be glad to help us
out. They'll prepare the ad. and let me have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it to-morrow. They want a quarter of a
page."</p>

<p>"They do? Well, well, Paul! That should
net the <i>Echo</i> something," Mr. Cameron remarked.
"If all the boys' mothers help them
as yours has, your <i>March Hare</i> will be a certainty
by to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You were a brick, Mater."</p>

<p>"I just happened to recall hearing the man
speak of it," returned Mrs. Cameron.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was quite evident that she
was pleased to aid her boy.</p>

<p>"You don't remember happening to hear any
one else mention advertising, do you, my
dear?" asked her husband.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," was his wife's laughing
reply.</p>

<p>"Don't tease Mater, Dad," said Paul.
"She's done her bit. May the others do as
well."</p>

<p>Rising from breakfast, he bent and kissed his
mother affectionately.</p>

<p>"I'm off to school!" he called. "I shall put
this advertising stunt up to the business manager.
He's got to expect to have something to
do."</p>

<p>"That's right, Paul," returned Mr. Cameron
approvingly. "The clever business man is the
one who organizes his affairs and then throws
at least a part of the responsibility of carrying
them out on the men in his employ. Nobody is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
ever interested in an undertaking in which he
has no part. Share your work with the other
fellow if you want to get the best out of him.
Put it on his shoulders and make him feel that
you expect him to do it&mdash;that you trust him to
do it. He'll do ten times as much for you and
he will pull with you&mdash;not against you. We're
all human and like to be important. Remember
that in handling men. It is one of the great
secrets of success. Now off with you! You'll
be late if you stand here philosophizing."</p>

<p>Away scampered Paul. A moment later his
wheel was crunching over the blue gravel of
the driveway and speeding down the macadam
road. Soon he was in the classroom.</p>

<p>Excitement ran high that morning. What
Cæsar did in Gaul, what Cyrus and the Silician
Queen had to say to one another was of far less
import to the agitated students than what the
Class of 1920 did that day in Burmingham.
Nevertheless the recitations dragged on somehow
and by and by the geometries, Roman histories,
and the peregrinations of Cyrus were
tucked into the desks, and the staff of the
<i>March Hare</i> got together for a hurried business
meeting in the corridor.</p>

<p>The boys were enthusiastic that Paul had
found a printer.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for you, Kipper!" they shouted.</p>

<p>"Good work, old man!"</p>

<p>"Leave it to Kip!" they cried in chorus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll have to get the ads.," announced
Paul. "I've secured one. I leave the rest of
them to you."</p>

<p>"Right-o! We'll 'tend to them," piped
Donald Hall with assurance.</p>

<p>"My father's firm has never advertised," declared
Dave Chandler. "I'll put it up to Pater
when I get home."</p>

<p>"My uncle will help us out; I bet he will,"
promised Oscar Hamilton. "Robey and Hamilton,
you know."</p>

<p>"The more the merrier," responded Paul
gayly. "Just call me up this evening and tell
me what luck you've had."</p>

<p>"Sure, old fellow! We'll do that!" came
from the boys as they dispersed.</p>

<p>The remainder of the morning Paul mingled
fragments of chemistry and Greek with visions
of the <i>March Hare</i>, and the moment school was
out he dashed home to complete his studying
and get it out of the way that he might be free
to go to see Judge Damon directly after dinner.</p>

<p>Despite the dignity of his profession the
judge was a much less formidable person to
face than Mr. Arthur Presby Carter. He was
a simple, kindly man, with an ingratiating smile
and a keen sympathy with human nature. He
was, moreover, very fond of young people.
He liked all boys, seeming never to forget the
fact that he himself had been one of them not
so many years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, no sooner had Paul presented
himself at the front door than he was shown
into the study where, before a bright fire blazing
on the hearth, the judge sat smoking.</p>

<p>"Come in, Paul," he called cordially. "Your
father told me about this undertaking of yours,
and I hear I am to be one of your victims."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, well! I suppose doing what we do
not enjoy is good for our characters," returned
the judge mischievously. "If you boys propose
to do some serious writing of English and
secure a little business experience, certainly
your aim is a worthy one and we older folks
should back you up. It's a far more sensible
vent for your energy, to my mind, than so much
football."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're not going to give over our football,
sir," asserted Paul with prompt candor.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Keep up your games by all
means. But moderation is a jewel. A little
football goes a good way, while business training
is never amiss."</p>

<p>"We expect to get quite a bit of business
training out of issuing our paper," said Paul
modestly.</p>

<p>"And in order to do it, you young rascals are
going to rope me into your schemes, are you?"
demanded the judge.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carter is."</p>

<p>"It's the same thing&mdash;or rather it isn't the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
same thing, for what I would not consent to
do for Mr. Carter I am going to do for you
boys."</p>

<p>Paul murmured his thanks.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! Say no more about it," Judge
Damon commanded hastily. "My son is in the
class, you know; surely I should be showing
little loyalty to 1920 if I were not ready to help
make it glorious; and even if I had no boy in
the High School it would be the same. I
should be glad to promote so worthy an undertaking."</p>

<p>From the litter of papers on the desk the man
took up a crisp white sheet which he folded
carefully and slipped into an envelope.</p>

<p>"There is a legal contract for Mr. Carter to
sign," he said. "It states that in consideration
of the <i>Echo</i> Press printing ten numbers of the
<i>March Hare</i>, I am to furnish Mr. Carter with
six articles on the League of Nations."</p>

<p>"It's mighty good of you, sir."</p>

<p>The judge waved his hand.</p>

<p>"Don't let the favor oppress you, sonny,"
he said. "Along with your father I am having
my little joke on Carter. I'd like to see his
face when you confront him with this bit of
paper. He'll be bound to carry out his bargain
whether he likes it or not."</p>

<p>"You don't think he'll back down."</p>

<p>"Carter back down! No, indeed. Mr.
Carter is a man of his word. Although I dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>fer
from him on just about every possible subject,
I am glad to give the devil his due. What
he promises he will stick to; never fear," Judge
Damon declared quickly.</p>

<p>This prediction proved to be no idle one for
when, within two or three days, Paul presented
himself once more in the library of Mr. Arthur
Presby Carter and placed in that august person's
hand not only the ten advertisements for
the <i>Echo</i> but his father's subscription to the
same paper, and the written agreement of the
judge, Mr. Carter, although plainly chagrined,
did not demur.</p>

<p>On the contrary he glanced keenly at the
youthful diplomat, observing grimly:</p>

<p>"You are an enterprising young man, I will
say that for you. I should not mind knowing
to what methods you resorted to win these concessions
from these stern-purposed gentlemen.
Did you bribe or chloroform them?"</p>

<p>The boy laughed triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Neither, sir."</p>

<p>"The judge, for example&mdash;I can't imagine
what influence could have been brought to bear
on him to have achieved such a result. I have
offered him a good price for those articles and
he has repeatedly refused it. And now he is
going to do them for nothing."</p>

<p>"He just wanted to help us out."</p>

<p>"And your father?"</p>

<p>"He was game, too."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Carter was silent.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I can be as good a sport as
they can," he observed at length. "Get your
material together for your first number of the
<i>March Hare</i> and bring it over to the <i>Echo</i> office.
I'll see that one of our staff gives you a
lesson on how to get it into form. Have you a
typewriter?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Know how to run one?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That's unlucky. We don't like to handle
copy that isn't typed. It's too hard on the eyes
and takes us too long. However, we must
make the best of it, I suppose. Only be sure
to write plainly and on but one side of the paper;
and do not fold or roll your sheets. That
is one thing no publisher will stand for&mdash;rolled
manuscript. Remember that."</p>

<p>"I will, sir."</p>

<p>"I guess that's all for now. Good night,
youngster."</p>

<p>"Good night, sir."</p>

<p>Although the leave-taking was curt it was
not unkind and Paul returned home with a feeling
that in spite of what he had heard of Mr.
Carter's character he neither feared nor disliked
the gruff man; in fact, in the sharp-eyed
visage there was actually something that appealed.
To his surprise the lad found himself
rather liking Mr. Carter.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">PAUL GIVES THANKS FOR HIS BLESSINGS</h3>


<p>When Paul came into the house that afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
his father called to him from the little den
off the hall.</p>

<p>"Come here a moment, son," he cried.
"I've something to show you."</p>

<p>The boy hurried forward, all curiosity. He
found his father seated before a desk on which
was spread an old manuscript, brightened here
and there by letters of blue or scarlet.</p>

<p>"Strangely enough, Mr. Jordan, the curio
collector, was in my office to-day and had this
treasure with him. When I mentioned that I
should like to have you see it, immediately, in
most generous fashion, he suggested that I
bring it home and show it to you. It is almost
priceless and of course I demurred; but he insisted.
He had just bought it at an auction in
New York and was, I fancy, glad to find some
one who was interested and would appreciate
it. It is not complete; if it were it would be
very valuable. It is just a few stray sheets
from an ancient psalter. Nevertheless its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
workmanship is exquisite and it is well worth
owning. Notice the beautiful lettering."</p>

<p>Paul bent over the vellum pages. The manuscript,
now spotted by age, was marvelously
penned, being written evenly and with extreme
care in Latin characters.</p>

<p>"Were all the old books written in Latin?"
he inquired with surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, and not only were the first manuscripts
and books phrased in Latin but most of the very
early printed books were written in the same
language," he answered. "In those days learning
was not for the general public. There was
no such spirit of democracy known as now
exists. It cheapened a thing to have it within
the reach of the vulgar herd. Even Horace,
much as we honor him, once complained because
some of his odes had strayed into the hands of
the common people 'for whom they were not
intended.' Books, in the olden time, were
held to be for only the fortunate few. The
educated class considered a little learning a
dangerous thing. If the people got to know
too much they were liable to become unruly and
less easy to handle. Therefore books were kept
out of their reach. In Germany there was
even a large fine and the penalty of imprisonment
imposed on any one who printed, published,
or bought a book translated from the
Latin or Greek unless such translation had pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>viously
been censored by the authorities.
Hence the people who could not read the languages
were entirely cut off from all literature."</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing!" exclaimed
Paul indignantly.</p>

<p>"No, you never did, thank God! We live
in an age and a country of freedom. But the
world has not always been so easy or so comfortable
a place to live in as it is now."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron touched the manuscript before
him daintily with his finger, betraying by the
gesture the reverence of the true book-lover.</p>

<p>"This book," he remarked, "is, as you see,
done on vellum. Most of the illuminators of
ancient books preferred that material for their
work. Papyrus such as the Romans used was
too brittle to be folded or sewed, and therefore
could not be bound into book form; it had to be
rolled on rollers, and even then was liable to
crack. It was far too perishable for bookmaking.
Hence the old scribes turned to vellum, or
sheepskin. But later, when the printing press
came along, vellum became very unpopular indeed,
because the grease in the skin spread the
ink or else would not absorb it, and the harsh
surface destroyed the type. Even had these
difficulties not arisen, vellum would have had
to be abandoned since the number of skins demanded
for the making of a thick book was
prohibitive. Imagine three hundred unlucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sheep offering up their skins in order to produce
one of the first printed Bibles!"</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" Paul whistled, regarding his
father with incredulity.</p>

<p>"I was as surprised as you when I read the
statement," declared his father. "At that
rate, where would the sheep be in a little while?
All slaughtered and made into books. Fortunately
the public of that day did not, as I
have already explained, care much for reading;
so perhaps that is the secret why some of the
sheep were spared."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they print their books on paper?"
inquired Paul thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>"Paper, you must remember, was not yet
discovered; that is, it was unknown in western
Europe. It had been in use in China, however,
for some time; but China was not a generous
country that spread its inventions to other
lands. What the Chinese discovered they kept
to themselves. Nor, in fact, was there any
extended means of spreading such things except
through the primitive methods of conquest
or travel. Wars enough there were, it is true;
but travel was very infrequent. Moreover, I
seriously doubt if scribes would have used paper
at just that period if they had had it. The
first attempts at paper-making resulted in a
crude, coarse product that was regarded with
great scorn by the rich; and as for printed matter,
the educated classes considered it a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
drop from handwork and too common a thing
to be purchased."</p>

<p>"How ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"It smacked of the masses," laughed Mr.
Cameron. "Elegant persons refused to use
anything so cheap. Snobbery existed among
the ancients, you see, quite as extensively as in
our own day, and a possession was only valuable
while it was the property of the fortunate
few. The instant it came within the reach of
everybody it was no longer desirable in their
eyes. Your snob always treasures a thing less
for its intrinsic value than because other people
cannot have it. So it was among the snobs
that lived hundreds of years ago; the species
has not materially changed. No sooner did
learning become general through the use of the
printing press, and become accessible to the
man in moderate circumstances than it lost its
savor for the rich, and many a noble boasted
that he was unable to read, write, or spell.
Learning suddenly became a vulgar accomplishment,
a thing to be spurned, ridiculed, and
avoided."</p>

<p>"I never heard of anything so absurd!" Paul
said with contempt.</p>

<p>"It is no more absurd than is much of our
present-day philosophy of life," replied Mr.
Cameron. "With all our enlightenment we
have not yet outgrown many of our follies."</p>

<p>He stopped, smiling whimsically to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul bent over the richly colored pages on
the table.</p>

<p>"I don't see," he remarked, "how they ever
bound such stuff as this."</p>

<p>"The books of that early time were indeed a
marvel," mused his father. "They were not
at all like the books we know now. Most of
them were ponderous affairs with board covers
from one to two inches thick. Around many
of these covers went a metal band, usually of
iron, to keep the boards from warping; and in
addition this band was frequently fastened
across the front with a mammoth clasp. Sometimes
there were even two of these bands. The
corners also were protected with metal, and to
guard the great volume from wear while it lay
upon its side, massive, round-headed nails studded
both covers. More of these big nails were
set in the metal corners."</p>

<p>"The thing must have weighed a ton!" exclaimed
Paul.</p>

<p>"A single book was a far heavier commodity
than you would have cared to hold in your lap,"
smiled Mr. Cameron. "In fact, it was impossible
to hold one of them; hence we find the old-time
reading desk used as a support. It was
indispensable."</p>

<p>"But what on earth could a person do with
such a book?" asked Paul. "Two or three of
them would fill a room."</p>

<p>"Almost," laughed his father. "People did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
not pretend to own many of them. In the first
place they cost too much; and in the next place
one could not have them lying about because
the nails in their sides scratched the tables.
Nor could they be arranged side by side on a
shelf, as we arrange books now, because of the
projecting nails or buttons. Their weight, too,
was a menace to safety. Petrarch almost lost
his leg by having a volume of Cicero which he
was reading fall on it."</p>

<p>"I always thought Cicero would much better
be left alone!" cut in Paul wickedly. "Thank
goodness that although I have to study Latin,
I don't have to do it out of a book of that size!"</p>

<p>"You do right to make the most of your
blessings," his father answered, with a twinkle
in his eye. "Such books were, to say the least,
awkward to handle. Most of them were kept
chained to the lecterns or desks of the churches;
sometimes even to the pillars."</p>

<p>"Chained?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," nodded Mr. Cameron. "Books
were too precious and rare to risk their
being stolen, as they doubtless would have been
had they been left about."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think anybody would have
wanted to carry a book big as the dictionary
very far."</p>

<p>"But suppose you were very eager to learn
to read and never had the chance to lay hands
on a book?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that would be different."</p>

<p>"That was the condition most of the persons
faced who were not rich enough to purchase
books, or have access to them as the scholars
in the monasteries had. For at that period
of history, you must recall, the Church was the
custodian of learning. Priests wrote the books,
copied them, had charge of such meager
libraries as there were, and taught the people.
There were neither schools nor libraries like
ours. What wonder that the public was ignorant
and illiterate?"</p>

<p>Paul was thoughtful for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Maybe schools are not such a bad thing,
Dad," he remarked, half in fun. "They are
dreadfully inconvenient, to be sure, when you
want to go and play football; still I guess we
are better off with them than we should be without
them."</p>

<p>"I reckon you'd think so, were you to try
the experiment of being without any," replied
Mr. Cameron. "By the way, how is your football
team coming on? I have not heard much
about it lately."</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to go out with the fellows
for any practice work," confessed Paul,
"so I am not so well up in what they are doing
as I ought to be. This paper of ours keeps me
hopping. We want to make the first issue a
bully one&mdash;so good that everybody who hasn't
subscribed will want to, double-quick. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
girls are working up a fine department on Red
Cross, canning, and all that sort of thing. I've
allowed them three pages for articles and items.
Hazel Clement is at the head of it. She's a
corking girl, and her mother is going to help her
some. Mrs. Clement has been on all sorts of
planning boards and committees, and National
Leagues and things," concluded Paul vaguely.</p>

<p>"It would be interesting to get Mrs. Clement
to write you an article some time," suggested
Mr. Cameron.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose she would?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. She is a very public-spirited
woman; moreover, she is quite as much interested
in the boys and girls of Burmingham as
the rest of us are, I am sure."</p>

<p>"I've a great mind to ask her," said Paul.
"If we could get one fine article a month from
some parent who has something to say, it would
help us tremendously. Of course, it would
have to be on something the scholars would be
keen on though: home gardens, or earning
money, or citizenship, or making things."</p>

<p>"I am certain that if you explained your
editorial policy to some of the grown-ups they
would submit manuscripts to you," returned
Mr. Cameron mischievously. "You would not
be obliged to bind yourself to publish them if
they were not satisfactory. Editors are always
at liberty to send contributions back with
a slip saying that the inclosed article does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
meet the needs of their paper, or else that there
is no room for it."</p>

<p>"Gee! Imagine my sending back an article
that some parent had written."</p>

<p>"If you are going to be an editor that will
be part of your business. You will have to
learn to discriminate between the articles that
are timely, well written, interesting, and in harmony
with the principles you have blocked out
for your magazine."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose Mr. Carter has to do
that?" asked Paul in an awed tone.</p>

<p>"Without question."</p>

<p>"Then no wonder he looks as if he would
freeze the blood in your veins," ejaculated the
boy. "It must make him almighty severe just
to keep reading stuff and sending back what he
doesn't like, regardless of who wrote it."</p>

<p>"He must keep up the standard of his paper,
son. His subscribers pay good money for it
and they want what they pay for. Were an
editor to take pity on every poor soul who sent
him an article his publication would soon be
filled with every sort of trash. He has to
train himself to be unprejudiced and give his
readers only the best the market affords. The
personal element does not enter into the matter."</p>

<p>"I see. I hadn't thought of that side of it,"
Paul confessed slowly.</p>

<p>His father watched him in silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should not let this matter worry me,"
observed the older man presently, "for I doubt
if you have so many unsolicited manuscripts
that you will be troubled with returning a great
number of them to their owners. And if you
find yourself overrun with them you can always
call in expert advice."</p>

<p>Paul brightened.</p>

<p>"I could ask somebody's opinion, couldn't
I?" he declared.</p>

<p>"Of course. Or you could consult with your
staff."</p>

<p>"My staff! Pooh! They wouldn't know
any more about it than I did," chuckled Paul.
"But you would, Dad, and so would Judge Damon.
I shall come straight to you if I get
stuck."</p>

<p>"Two heads are often better than one," responded
Mr. Cameron kindly. "Bring your
problem home, my boy, if you find it too big for
you. Together we'll thrash it out."</p>

<p>"You certainly are a trump, Dad!" cried
Paul. "I guess between us all we can make a
go of the <i>March Hare</i>."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it!" responded his father.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">A GAME OF CARDS</h3>


<p>The first copy of the <i>March Hare</i> came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
amid great excitement,&mdash;excitement that
spread not only through the Burmingham High
School but into the home of almost every child
in the town. It was a good number, exceptionally
so, even as the product of an undergraduate
body of students who were most of them amateurs
at the writing game.</p>

<p>A page of the magazine was given up to each
of the classes and contained items of interest
to freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors
respectively; there was a page of alumnæ
notes; another page devoted to general school
news; a section on school sports; another section
on girls' clubs and handicraft. The drawing
master contributed a page or two on poster-making;
and Mrs. Clement was prevailed upon
to write a bright and practical article on the
making of an iceless refrigerator.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Carter, old newspaper warhorse
that he was, was compelled to admit that the
<i>March Hare</i> was not half so mad as it was
painted. In fact, he grudgingly owned to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of his employees that the new publication was
quite a masterpiece for the youngsters. He
had not dreamed they could do so well. It was
a great surprise to him. Why, the product
was quite an eye opener! A paper for general
home use might not be such a bad thing in
Burmingham. There was actually something
in this <i>March Hare</i> worth while for grown-ups.
If the following issues continued to be of the
present order of merit, the <i>Echo</i> had nothing
to blush for in fostering the scheme. As for
that Paul Cameron, he was a boy worth watching.
He would make his mark some day.</p>

<p>Coming from a man who habitually said so
little, such praise was phenomenal and it
spurred Paul, to whom it was repeated, to increased
effort. He must keep his paper up to
this standard, that was certain.</p>

<p>With such a varied group of opinions to harmonize
as was represented by his editorial staff,
this was not altogether an easy task. Each
boy stressed the thing he was specially interested
in and saw no reason for publishing anything
else in the paper. Some thought more
room should be given to athletics; some clamored
that the "highbrow stuff" be cut out;
others were for choking off the girls' articles on
canning and fancy work. There were hectic
meetings at which the youthful literary pioneers
squabbled, and debated, and almost came
to blows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>But Paul Cameron was a boy of unusual tact.
He heard each objector in turn and patiently
smoothed away his objections until, upon a
battlefield of argument from which scars of
bitterness might have survived, a harmonious
body of workers finally stood shoulder to shoulder,
each with enthusiasm to make the particular
part of the work for which he was responsible
finer and more efficient. It was, as Paul
declared to his colleagues, a triumph of teamwork.</p>

<p>It had never, perhaps, come to the minds of
the boys that teamwork was a term that could
be applied to work as well as to play. Business
and sport seemed vitally different fields of activity.
Yet here they were&mdash;a group of boys
pulling together, each at the post assigned him&mdash;toiling
for the success of the whole body.
Was it such a different thing from football or
baseball after all? Business managers, authors,
advertising agents, were working quite
as hard to do their part as ever they had worked
at right or left tackle; as first baseman, or
pitcher, or catcher. The present task simply
demanded a different type of energy, that was
all. The same old slogan of each for the whole
was applicable.</p>

<p>Consequently every man took up his duties
with a pride in his especial role on the team, and
as a result the second issue of the <i>March Hare</i>
over-topped the first, and the third the second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Young people who did not go to the High
School at all mailed subscriptions to the business
manager; the alumnæ, now scattered in
every direction, began to write for the publication
to be sent them; it was good, they said, to
get once more into touch with their Alma
Mater. Older persons who had no children
turned in applications for the <i>March Hare</i>.
They had seen a copy of the paper and liked it.</p>

<p>Into Paul's editorial sanctum articles from
parents who had things to say and wished to
say them gradually found their way. Many
of these persons had done little writing and
would not have presumed to send their attempts
to a magazine of a more professional character.</p>

<p>Mr. Lemuel Hardy, for example, submitted
a humorous poem on how the grapes disappeared
from his stone wall,&mdash;a poem so amusing
and so good-natured yet withal containing
such a pitiful little refrain of disappointment
that the seniors at once took it upon themselves
to see that no more of Lemuel's grapes were
molested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilbur wrote on raising, transplanting,
and caring for currant bushes. Was it really
so hard as that to bring a good crop of fruit to
perfection? If so, the boy was a brute who invaded
Mrs. Wilbur's garden. 1920 would see
that there was no more of that!</p>

<p>Gladys Marvin's father sent to the paper a
short article on the beauty of the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
stones when polished and offered to polish, for
a small sum, any specimen brought him. Many
of the pupils of the school availed themselves
of this suggestion, and before a
month was out there blossomed forth a
host of stones of every imaginable hue set in
rings or scarfpins of silver. Stone-hunting
became a craze and the geological department
gained scores of pupils in consequence. One
heard murmurs about quartz and crystals as
one passed through the school corridors, and
one came upon eager scientists comparing
rings, brooches, or pendants.</p>

<p>The drawing department was beset with pupils
who wished either to make designs for
jewelry, or to look over books on ancient settings
for gems.</p>

<p>Louise Clausen had a necklace she had made
herself at arts and crafts class; it was set
with stones she had collected&mdash;common
pebbles that had been polished&mdash;and it was the
envy of the entire student body. Her mother
had let her melt up an old silver butter-dish to
make it, she explained.</p>

<p>Burmingham boys and girls went home <i>en
masse</i> and begged to be allowed to melt up old
water pitchers, mugs, or napkin rings, and fashion
jewelry.</p>

<p>Out of the jumble of material turned in from
various sources one number after another of
the <i>March Hare</i> appeared, each marked by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
freshness of subject matter and a freedom of
expression in such complete contrast to other
publications that even such an august medium
as the <i>Echo</i> broke over its traditions to a sufficient
extent to glean an idea here and there
from the infant prodigy and enlarge upon it.</p>

<p>Once no less a personage than Mr. Arthur
Presby Carter himself asked of Paul permission
to reprint in the columns of his paper an
article that had particularly appealed to him
as unique and interesting.</p>

<p>"I tried," declared Paul, when relating the
incident to his father, "not to fall all over myself
when granting the permission. I told him
that of course the thing was copyrighted, but
that we should be glad to have him use it on the
condition that he printed the source from which
he had obtained it. One of his men told me
afterward that we let him off too easy&mdash;that
Carter was determined to have the article, and
would have paid us a good sum for the privilege
of republishing it. We never thought of
charging him for it; we were proud as Punch
to have him reprint it."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron laughed. Paul's frankness had
always been one of the lad's greatest charms.</p>

<p>"Pride goeth before destruction, my son,"
he remarked jestingly. "However, perhaps you
did as well not to put a price on your product.
Mr. Carter has done quite a little to boost your
undertaking and you can afford to grant him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a favor or two. But I will say you are getting
pretty deep into newspaper work, Paul."</p>

<p>"I do seem to be, don't I?" smiled Paul,
flushing boyishly. "I'm crazy over it, too.
The more you do at it the better you like it.
I don't know but that when I'm through college,
I'd like to go in and be a reporter. I'd
like to write up fires and accidents and wear a
little badge that would admit me inside the lines
at parades and political meetings."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'd find there was lots to it
besides the badge and the pleasure of stalking
under the ropes."</p>

<p>"I suppose so; but I'd like the chance to try
it. I've always envied those chaps who whispered
some magic word and walked in while the
rest of us waited outside."</p>

<p>"There you go!" cried his father. "You
are just as bad at wanting what other people
cannot have as ever were the early book collectors!"</p>

<p>Paul colored.</p>

<p>"I know it," he admitted. "I'm afraid we
all enjoy having a pull and getting the best of
other people. It is human nature."</p>

<p>"It is human, that is true; nevertheless, the
impulse is a very selfish one," said his father.</p>

<p>A silence fell upon the two. They were sitting
in the living room and it was almost Paul's
bedtime. Outside the rain was beating on the
windows; but inside a fire crackled on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hearth and a crimson glow from the silken
lampshade made cheery the room.</p>

<p>"I was telling the fellows to-day some of the
things you told me about early bookmaking,
Dad," remarked Paul. "They wanted to know
if printing came soon after the illuminated
books, and who invented it. I couldn't answer
their question and as yet have had no time to
look up the matter. We had quite a discussion
about it. Perhaps you can save me the trouble
of overhauling an encyclopedia."</p>

<p>"I've no business to save you from such an
expedition," retorted Mr. Cameron with amusement.
"Morally, the best thing you can do is
to look up the answer to your question yourself.
It is good for you. However, because the subject
happens to interest me, I am going to be
weak enough to reply to your query. Printing
did follow the hand-illuminated and hand-penned
manuscripts and books; but before
printed books made their appearance, there was
an interval when printers tried to say what they
had to say by means of pictures. You know
how we give a child a picture book as a first
approach to more serious reading. He is too
undeveloped to comprehend printed words; but
he can understand pictures. It was just so in
the olden days. The uneducated masses of
people were as simple as children. Hence the
pioneer printers' initial efforts were turned in
the direction of playing cards, pictures for home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
decoration&mdash;or <i>images</i>, as they were called&mdash;and
genuine picture books, where the entire
story was told by a series of illustrations."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron paused in his narrative.</p>

<p>"You can readily see, if you think for a moment,"
he presently went on, "how such an innovation
came about. Paper had not been invented,
and vellum was not only costly but too
limited in supply to permit many books being
printed. Moreover, as I told you, hand in hand
with this objection was the fact that the majority
of the public had no interest in learning.
Their intellects were immature. They were
nothing but grown-up children, and you know
how children like games and picture books.
Well, those are the reasons why the next step in
the development of printing was in the direction
of making playing cards. A coarse,
thick, yellowish paper was beginning to
be produced&mdash;the first crude attempt at paper-making&mdash;and
on this material were engraved
woodcuts of varying degrees of artistic merit.
Some of the designs were merely ugly and
clumsy; but some, on the other hand, were
really exquisite examples of hand-coloring,
unique and quaint in pattern. Thus playing
cards came speedily into vogue. The finest
ones were painted on tablets of ivory, or engraved
on thin sheets of silver. It is interesting,
too, to note that the old conventional
designs then in use have, with very little modi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>fication,
persisted up to the present day. Probably
the playing cards in common use were
printed by the same crude method as were the
images, and unfortunately history has failed
to unravel just what that method was. They
may possibly have been stenciled. All we have
been able to learn is that cards, images (which
were in reality religious pictures), and stenciled
altar cloths&mdash;the first primitive printing
on cloth&mdash;all appeared very early in southern
Europe, playing cards having their origin in
Venice, where in 1400 and even before that
date we read of the Venetians playing cards."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose their games were anything
like ours?" questioned Paul, much interested.</p>

<p>"I doubt it. Probably, for example, there
was no bridge whist in those days," said his
father, with a chuckle. "And I'll wager, too,
the Venetians were quite as happy and as well
off without it. The games of the time were
doubtless much more simple. But whatever
they were, they proved to be so fascinating that
they soon became an actual menace. Amusements
were few in those dull, monotonous days,
when there were neither theaters, books, moving
pictures, railroads, or automobiles. One
day was much like another. Therefore even
the clergy welcomed a diversion and devoted so
much time to cards that the recreation had to
be forbidden them. Now and then some great
religious movement would sweep over the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and break up card-playing; but after a little
respite people always returned to it with even
greater zest than before. Nor was it a wholly
bad thing. In the absence of schools the games
quickened the intellect and made the common
people mentally more alert; the ignorant
were also trained by this means to count and
solve simple problems in arithmetic, of which
most of them knew nothing."</p>

<p>"That's a funny way to get arithmetic lessons,"
said Paul.</p>

<p>"Yet you can see that a knowledge of numbers
could be thus obtained?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Of course. But I never thought
of it before."</p>

<p>"Remember that the race had reverted to its
childhood during the Dark Ages," explained
Mr. Cameron. "For years all its attention had
been given to warfare, and learning and the arts
which had been destroyed by constant strife and
turmoil had to be built up again."</p>

<p>"But to have people learn arithmetic by
means of playing cards!" mused Paul.</p>

<p>"Better that way than not at all. It helped
the big result by gradually making them realize
how little they knew, and making them want
to know more, which was the necessary spur to
learning. You will be interested also to know,
since we are discussing playing cards, that the
four suits are said to represent the four great
social classes of society at that time. Hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
stood for the clergy; Spades (spada meaning
a sword) for the nobility; Clubs for the peasantry;
and Diamonds for the more prosperous
citizens or burghers."</p>

<p>"That is interesting, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"And the images?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the image-prints were small religious
pictures done in color," answered his father,
"and I fear they were often valued far more
for their brilliant hues than for their religious
significance. They represented all sorts of
subjects, being taken largely from incidents in
the lives of the saints. You know that at that
time in many countries, especially in Italy, religious
dramas were presented&mdash;plays such as
Everyman and Saint George and the Dragon.
Hence such scenes were constantly before the
people, and they were very familiar with them.
The small image-prints served to perpetuate
to a great extent things which they liked and
knew; and the picture books, which gave not
only these scenes in other form, but also reproduced
stories from the Bible, did the same. No
text was necessary. The picture told the tale
to a people who could not read, just as the
stained-glass windows and mosaics in the
churches did. Everywhere the feeble literature
of the period took the form either of verbal
minstrelsy, drama, or pictured representations.
You will recall how most of the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
races first wrote in pictures instead of letters.
There were hieroglyphics in Egypt; 'speaking
stories' in Assyria; and picture-writing in
Turkey, China, and Japan. The picture book
of the time was merely an attempt to put into
simple outline, by means of woodcuts, the religious
drama, or dumb shows of the day. The
city of Florence did much for this form of
work, its <i>rappresentazioni</i> being printed as
early as 1485. Albrecht Dürer of Germany
was one of the later and most skilful woodcut
artists. What the ballad was to literature the
woodcut was to art&mdash;simple, direct, appealing."</p>

<p>The man paused.</p>

<p>"The printed story awaited several necessary
factors to bring it into being. One was a
public that desired to read&mdash;which this one did
not; another was a means by which to print
reading matter; a third was suitable paper on
which to print; and the fourth, but by no means
the least important, a good and proper quality
of ink. One after another these difficulties
were done away with. If they had not been,"
concluded Mr. Cameron, "you would not now
have been publishing such a thing as the <i>March
Hare</i>."</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">A MAD TEA PARTY</h3>


<p>It was amazing to see how the general interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in the <i>March Hare</i> increased as the
months went by. So successful was the magazine
that Paul ventured an improvement in the
way of a patriotic cover done in three colors&mdash;an
eagle and an American flag designed by one
of the juniors and submitted for acceptance in
a "cover contest", the prize offered being a
year's subscription to the paper. After this
innovation came the yet more pretentious and
far-reaching novelty of the Mad Tea Party,
a supper held in the hall of the school with
seventy-five-cent tickets for admission. The
mothers of the pupils contributed the food, and
as Burmingham boasted many an expert cook
the meal spread upon the tables was indeed a
royal one.</p>

<p>The edict went forth that no guest would be
admitted to the festival unless arrayed in an
"Alice in Wonderland" costume, and for the
sake of witnessing the fun, as well as of helping
forward the fête, <a name="q074" id="q074"></a>more than one dignified resident
of the town struggled into an incongruous garment
and mingled in the train of Alice,
the White Queen, the Red Queen, the Duchess,
Father William, and the Aged Man. Judge
Damon and Mr. Cameron provoked a storm
of mirth by appearing as the Walrus and
the Carpenter, and Paul's mother, who was
still a young and pretty woman, came as the
famous Queen of Hearts. As for Mr. Carter,
although he pooh-poohed the idea and made all
manner of jokes about the party, he astonished
the entire community by presenting himself at
the last moment as the Dormouse.</p>

<p>Such a revel had not taken place in the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
for years. In fact, there had never before
been any social function which brought
high and low, rich and poor together in such
democratic fashion. The frolic had in it a
Mardi Gras spirit quite foreign to the wonted
quiet and dignity of the place.</p>

<p>"Why, we haven't had such a shaking-up
in years!" ejaculated the postmaster. "Seems
like we've all got better acquainted with our
neighbors in this one evening than we ever did
in all the rest of our lives put together. You
don't get far at knowing a man if you just bow
to him every day; but when you go making an
ape of yourself and he goes making an ape of
himself, each of you finds out how human the
other one is. You've got something in common
to talk about."</p>

<p>And it was even as the old postmaster declared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Many a social barrier was broken
down and forgotten as a result of the <i>March
Hare</i> carnival. Parents ceased to remember
their differences by talking together about their
children, a topic that never failed to bring them
into sympathy. Thus the movement which had
its source in an impulse to aid the youngsters
proved to be of benefit also to many of the elders.
Nor was this the only consequence of the
event.</p>

<p>Into the coffers of the class treasury poured
undreamed-of wealth which made possible the
gift of two fine pictures to the school,&mdash;one of
Washington and one of Lincoln; a large cast
of the Winged Victory was purchased as well,
and placed in an empty niche in the assembly
hall. Thus did 1920 leave behind it a memory
illustrious and not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>In the meantime Paul, absorbed in this successful
undertaking, was so busy that he had
scarcely leisure to eat. The editing of the paper
demanded more and more time, and as new
problems were constantly arising concerning
its publication he did not neglect to glean from
every possible direction all the information he
could about printing. The mere act of preparing
copy for the press opened to his alert mind
a multitude of inquiries.</p>

<p>"I read to-day," he announced to his father
one evening, "that the printing press was invented
by Lawrence Coster (or Lorenz Koster)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of Haarlem. The book said that he went on a
picnic with his family, and while idly carving
his name on the trunk of a beech tree he conceived
the idea that he might in the same way
make individual letters of the alphabet on
wooden blocks, ink them over, and thus print
words."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron listened attentively.</p>

<p>"Such is the old legend," he replied. "It is
an interesting one and many persons believe it
to this day. History, however, fails to bear
out the tale. Instead, as nearly as we can find
out, what Coster is really conceded to have done
was not to invent printing but to be the first to
make movable type, which was one of the greatest
factors in the perfecting of the industry.
Holland has done honor, and rightly, to the inventor
by placing a statue of him at Haarlem;
but the real inventor of printing was probably
John Gutenburg, a native of <a name="Strasburg" id="Strasburg"></a>Strasbourg, who
made a printing press which, although not so
elaborate as that in present use, was nevertheless
a properly constructed one. Simple as it
was, the principle of it is identical with that
used to-day."</p>

<p>"That is curious, isn't it?" observed Paul.</p>

<p>"Yes. Think how long ago it was; from
1440 to 1460 he toiled at his invention. He
was a versatile man, being not only skilled in
polishing precious stones but also at making
mirrors. The making of mirrors was a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
trade in Germany for outside the borders of
Venice, where the monopoly had long been
held by Italian workmen, the industry was almost
unknown. It is possible that Gutenburg
may have used the presses and even the lead
employed for molding the mirror frames to
work out his metal type. Doubtless his knowledge
of melting and pouring lead was derived
from his mirror-making trade. We know,
however, little of his experiments. He worked
in secret, spending years in research and wasting
other years in delays, when money to further
his invention was not forthcoming. His
first printing was done about 1439 or 1440, and
from that time up to 1460 he was busy printing
and struggling to make his work more perfect."</p>

<p>"What did he print in those early days?"
inquired Paul. "Books?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A few pages from them remain and
are to be seen at the National Library at Paris.
The letters used are very coarse and uneven
and are in the Latin type employed by the monks
in writing their manuscripts. It is almost a
romance to picture Gutenburg shut up in the
old ruined monastery where he worked night
and day with one of his faithful helpers&mdash;a
goldsmith who had long been in his employ&mdash;and
two other tried and trusty apprentices.
You can see how necessary it was that he have
men whom he could rely on not to divulge his
secret. Probably the goldsmith's knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of metals was of service to his master in the
undertaking; as for the joiner who had previously
aided in constructing mirror frames, he
made most of the tools. We don't know much
about the third workman, but we do know that
later one of the trio died very suddenly, and the
interruption to Gutenburg's work caused great
delay. Fearful that in the meantime the secret
of the invention might leak out, or that the old
servant's heirs might insist on having a share
in the discovery, Gutenburg melted up his
forms and abandoned further labor for a time.
This was a great pity, for by destroying what
he had done the inventor had it all to create
over again later on. His rash act did, however,
prove one thing which history wanted to
know, and that was that Gutenburg used metal
forms and not wood to make his letters."</p>

<p>"How soon did he re-make his metal
forms?" asked Paul eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not right away," responded Mr. Cameron.
"He was deeply in debt and a good deal discouraged
by the death of his efficient workman
on whom he was very dependent. For six
years we hear no more of him. Then he appeared
at Metz where he began borrowing
money again, just as he had done before. He
was fortunate in securing the aid needed, and
it is from this period on that his best printing
was done. He now branched out into more
ambitious tasks, producing a copy of the Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Bible in three volumes. This pretentious undertaking
of course required a great many letters,
and he found that to cut them by hand was
too slow a process; moreover, the lead letters
were very soft and wore down quickly. He
must cast his letters in brass molds and make
them of more durable metal. But alas, such an
innovation was costly and his money had given
out. Therefore, much as he dreaded to part
with his secret, he was forced to take into partnership
a rich metal worker by the name of
John Faust."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron paused to think a moment.</p>

<p>"It was thus that Gutenburg procured the
brass for his molds; made in them letters of
harder material; and printed his Bible. With
the production of this masterpiece came a
strange happening, too. You can see that by
printing from letters cast in molds the text was
more regular than was the handwork done by
the priests and monks. Hence when Charles
VII of France saw one of the new Bibles he
was enchanted with it and eagerly bought it
because of its uniform text. The next day he
displayed his recently acquired treasure to the
Archbishop with no little pride, and great was
his astonishment when the Archbishop asserted
with promptness that he himself owned
a newly purchased Bible that was quite as perfect
in execution. The king protested that
such a miracle could not be&mdash;that no one could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
write by hand two such copies. To settle the
dispute the Archbishop's Bible was produced
and placed beside the king's, and there they
were, identically the same. The dignitaries
were troubled. It was not humanly possible
to pen by hand two such books. Why, it would
take a lifetime&mdash;more than a lifetime; nor
could any penman write two manuscripts so
exactly alike. To make the matter worse and
more puzzling, other copies were discovered
precisely like the king's and the Archbishop's.
Not a line or letter varied. It was magic!"</p>

<p>Paul laughed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"No wonder the poor king and the stately
archbishop were upset!" he said.</p>

<p>"They were very much upset indeed," agreed
his father. "It was, you must recall, a superstitious
age. Everything that could not be
fathomed was attributed to witchcraft. Hence
witchcraft was the only explanation of the
present miracle. John Faust, of whom the two
royal persons had bought the books, must have
sold himself to the devil. They would have the
unlucky merchant brought, and if he could not
satisfactorily tell how and where he had got
the Bibles, he should be burned alive."</p>

<p>"I suppose he went and told!" put in Paul
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did. He wasn't going to forfeit
his life. I fancy any of us would have done
the same, too. He showed the Archbishop his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
press and explained how the Bibles had been
printed."</p>

<p>"It was a pity he had to."</p>

<p>"It was something of a pity," answered Mr.
Cameron. "And yet the secret must have
come out sometime, I suppose, for subsequently
Faust quarreled with Gutenburg and by and by
set up a press of his own at Metz, and with
two printing presses in the same town, and the
workmen necessary to run them mingling with
the populace, it was impossible to keep such an
invention from the public. Gradually it became
common property and it had become universal
when Metz was sacked in the Franco-Prussian
War, its printing rooms destroyed,
and the workmen scattered."</p>

<p>"Did that put an end to printing?" questioned
Paul.</p>

<p>"No. On the contrary it spread the art over
France and Germany. By 1500 there were
over fifty presses on the continent. In the
meantime William Caxton, an English merchant,
traveled to Holland to buy cloth, and
there became so much interested in the books
he saw and the tale of how they were printed
that he purchased some type and, bringing it
home, set up a printing press in London not far
from Westminster Abbey. The first English
book to be printed was dated 1474 and was
called 'The Game of Chess.' Then came a
Bible which was presented to the king. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
this time on there was practically an end to the
handwritten books made by the monks in cloisters
and monasteries. Occasionally such a volume
was made for the very rich because, as I
told you, the elegant still considered paper and
the printed book too common and cheap for
their use. But with the steady improvement
of ink and paper and the awakening desire of
the masses to read what was printed came the
dawn of religious liberty and the birth of learning."</p>

<p>"It is a wonderful story!" cried Paul, much
moved.</p>

<p>"A book in itself, isn't it?" said his father.
"It is an interesting fact, however, that Latin
and the Latin text continued to be the language
of the printed book for some time; this was not
only because of an established precedent, but
because the Renaissance in Italy revived an interest
in classic literature. But by and by
people demanded books in their native tongue.
They wished to read something besides the
classics&mdash;literature that was alive and a part
of their own era. The written <i>novello</i>, or
story, began to take the place of the ballads
which the <i>trouveurs</i>, or minstrels who wandered
from castle to castle, had chanted. One
was no longer dependent on such a story-teller.
The printed novel had arrived. Its form was
still very crude, but it was nevertheless a story
and a broader field for entertainment than was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
provided by the threadbare lives of the saints.
Science, too, was making remarkable progress
and the public was alert to read of Bacon and
Galileo, as well as of Luther and Shakespeare.
Had printing come earlier it would have been to
a passive, indifferent populace; now it appeared
in answer to the craving of a people
thirsty to read of travel, invention, poetry; to
consume the Tales of King Arthur, Sir John
Mandeville's Travels, Sidney's 'Arcadia',
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The Elizabethans
reflected in England the rebirth of literature
and learning which was sweeping all Europe
at the time. Printing was not the herald,
nor yet the servant, of this wonderful age; but
was rather its companion, going hand in hand
with it and making all the wealth of thought
that it had to give available to us, as well as to
those of its own day."</p>

<p>"Long live Gutenburg!" exclaimed Paul.</p>

<p>"Yes, we owe him a great deal," agreed Mr.
Cameron. "But do not become confused and
attribute everything to him. He did invent
type molds for casting type and thereby
brought printing to the point of a practical art.
He did not invent engraving on wood, as many
enthusiasts acclaim; nor did he invent impressions
of relief surfaces. He was not, moreover,
the first to print on paper, for the makers
of playing cards and image-prints had done
that before him. There had also been roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
printed books before his day and printing
presses, too. There had even been movable
type. But Gutenburg was the first to combine
these ideas so that they could be used for practical
purposes. In other words, he was the first
practical typographer, not the first printer.
Upon the foundation that other men had
built in, he reared a permanent, useful art
without which there could not have been either
enlightenment or education."</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE ROMANCE OF BOOKMAKING</h3>


<p>"Ever since last night, Dad," remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Paul, the next evening at dinner, "I have been
wondering how the old printers got rid of the
Latin text, lettering, or whatever you call it,
and got down to printing in English like ours."</p>

<p>"You're starting on a long story," replied
Mr. Cameron, glancing up from his plate.
"The development of our modern type requires
a volume in itself. Many scholars and many
craftsmen contributed to that glorious result.
It did not come all in a minute. Gutenburg's
uneven Latin lettering was a far cry from our
uniform, clear, well-designed variety of print.
In the first place, as I told you before, good ink
and good paper were necessary to beautiful
text, and these Gutenburg did not have. Gradually,
however, as a result of repeated experiments,
paper and ink that were of practical
value were manufactured. China had long
been successful in printing because of the fine
texture of her paper. Italy, the home of the
arts, caught up Gutenburg's invention and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
brought not only lettering but paper-making to
a marvelous degree of perfection."</p>

<p>"Italy and China always seem to be doing
things," laughed Paul.</p>

<p>"Both nations were inventive and original,"
answered Mr. Cameron. "The difference between
them was that while China locked all her
discoveries up within her own walled cities,
Italy shared her knowledge with the rest of the
world and made it and herself immortal."</p>

<p>"The Italians were a great people, weren't
they?"</p>

<p>"They were true lovers of all that was best
and most beautiful," answered his father
gravely. "Even their aristocracy felt it no
disgrace to toil to perfect a fine art. To make
that which was excellent more excellent still
was the aim of rich and poor. Nobles, artisans,
barefooted friars worked together towards that
common goal. It was an Italian prince, Nicholas
V, a man who afterward became Pope,
who founded the Vatican Library and collected
five thousand books, at a time, you must remember,
when a book was a rare and almost priceless
treasure. To him we owe the preservation
of many a valuable old manuscript that might
otherwise have been destroyed. Five thousand
volumes was in those days a vast number
to get together."</p>

<p>"Our public libraries would not think so
now," smiled Paul.</p>

<p>"No, because at present books are so easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
within reach that we scarcely appreciate them.
We certainly read only a very small proportion
of them."</p>

<p>"I know I don't read many," said Paul soberly.</p>

<p>"You will read more as you grow older,
son," returned his father kindly. "But most
of us are intellectually lazy; even grown-up
persons devote a good part of their short lives
to reading things that profit them nothing."</p>

<p>"Things like the <i>March Hare</i>, for example,"
suggested Paul facetiously.</p>

<p>"Many a worse thing than the <i>March Hare</i>,
I'm afraid," his father responded. "We seem
to think we have unlimited time before us, and
that there is no hurry about reading the good
things we mean to read before we die; so we
waste our precious moments on every sort of
trash&mdash;cheap novels, worthless magazines,
newspaper gossip, and before we know it, our
lives are gone. I overlook your being so foolish;
but for me it is inexcusable. The Italians
of the Renaissance did not give themselves over
to such folly. They put their hearts seriously
into building up their age and generation.
Lorenzo de Medici dragged from the corners of
Europe and Asia some two hundred Greek and
Latin manuscripts. Other Florentines, Venetians,
Romans collected private libraries.
Princes of the land turned their wealth not to
their own idle pleasure but to financing Gutenburg's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
invention and establishing printing
presses which the culture and brain of the
country controlled. There was a printing
press at the Vatican itself, and scholars who
were paid large salaries met in consultation
concerning the literature printed. The best
artists contributed their skill to the undertaking.
Indeed, it was a disagreement about some
theological work that Martin Luther had come
from Germany to help with that sent him back
home in a temper. And not only was the matter
printed carefully scrutinized but also every
detail of its production was thought out&mdash;the
size of the page, the size of the type, the
width of the margins, the quality of the
paper, the variety of type to be used. What
wonder that under such conditions printing was
rapidly transformed from a trade to an art.
When we think of the exquisite books made in
this far-away day, we sigh at our present output."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron's face clouded, then brightened.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless when all is said and done,
books are not for the person of wealth alone.
The work of the Aldi of Italy, the Elzevirs of
Leyden, the Estiennes of Paris, although of
finest quality, was much too expensive for universal
use. For it is the subject matter inside
the book which, when all is said and done, is
the thing we are after, and which we are eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to spread abroad; and never in any age has
every type of literature been so cheap and accessible,
or the average of culture so high as
now. If a person is ignorant to-day it is his
own fault. Nothing stands between him and
the stars but his own laziness and indifference."</p>

<p>"<i>Time</i>, my dear Henry," interrupted Mrs.
Cameron. "Do not leave out the element of
time. Remember that the farther away we get
from the beginning of learning, the greater
accumulation there is for us to master. Like
a mammoth snowball, each century has rolled
up its treasure until such a mass has come down
to us that it is practically impossible for us to
possess ourselves of it. Sometimes when I
think of all there is to know, I am depressed."</p>

<p>"And me, too, Mater," echoed Paul. "It
seems hopeless."</p>

<p>"But there are short outs," argued Mr. Cameron.
"No one expects any of us to read all
the books of the past. The years have sifted
the wheat from the chaff, and by a process of
elimination we have found out pretty well by
this time what the great books are. By classifying
our subjects we can easily trace the
growth and development of any of the really
significant movements of the world; we can
follow the path of the sciences; study the progress
of the drama from its infancy to the present
moment; trace the growth of the novel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
note the perfecting of the poetic form. History,
philosophy, the thought of all the ages is
ours. That is what I mean when I say there is
no excuse for persons of our era being uninformed.
We are reaping the results of many
unfoldings and can see things with a degree of
completeness that our ancestors could not; they
looked at life's problems from the bottom of the
hill and got only a partial view; we are seeing
them from the top, and understanding&mdash;or we
should be understanding&mdash;more fully, their interrelation."</p>

<p>"I suppose," mused Paul thoughtfully, "that
those who come after us will see even farther
than we."</p>

<p>"They ought to, and I believe they will,"
his father answered. "<i>Nothing walks with
aimless feet</i>, in my opinion. It is all part of a
gigantic, divine plan. The small beginnings
of the past have been the seed of to-day's harvest.
We thank Gutenburg for our books.
We thank such men as Nicholas V and many
another of his ilk for the Vatican Library, the
British Museum, the numberless foreign museums;
we owe a debt to our nation for our own
Congressional Library, to say nothing of the
smaller ones that, through the public spirit of
generous citizens, have opened their doors to
our people and done so much to educate and democratize
our country."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"And quite aside from the thousands of volumes
written in our own language, we have access
to the literature of other nations both in
translation and in their mother tongue. Remember
that after printing had got well under
way, type in other languages&mdash;Arabic, Greek,
Hebrew&mdash;had to be developed in order that
the literature of other languages might augment
our own."</p>

<p>"I don't think I took that into account," remarked
Paul.</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Mr. Cameron less
seriously, "not every person of the olden time
was alert for learning. Human nature was
much the same then as now.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid even in the midst of all this
thirst for knowledge there were those who
cared far more for the outside of a book than
for the inside," he continued humorously.
"Books were bound in brocade, in richly ornamented
leather embossed with gilt; some had
covers of gold or silver studded with gems,
while others were adorned with carved ivory
or enamel. As time went on and the religious
manuscripts written, illuminated, and
bound by the monks gave place to the more
elaborate productions of a printing age, ecclesiasts
were not skilful enough to do the illustrating
demanded, and a guild of bookbinders
sprang up. Into the hands of artists outside
the cloister were put the more dainty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
worldly pictures required by secular text.
Then followed a period when scholars who
owned books were no longer forced to loan them
to students to copy for their own use, as had
been the case in the past. Books became less
expensive and were accessible to everybody.
Slowly they were got into more practical form&mdash;were
made smaller and less bulky; not only
outside but inside they were improved. 'The
Lives of Saints' and Fox's 'Book of Martyrs'
gave way first to the tales of Merlin and
King Arthur in various versions, stories of
Charlemagne, and romances of similar character.
Copyrights being unknown, there was
no law to protect a book, and hence all the adventures
of the hero of any one tongue were
passed on to the favorite hero of another nationality;
as a result French, Italian, Spanish,
and Celtic literature teem with heroes who perform
marvellous deeds of identical character."</p>

<p>Paul was amused.</p>

<p>"Amadis of France, the popular idol of the
French people, worked the same marvels as
King Arthur did, only under another name.
Every nation borrowed (or rather stole) from
every other. It was not considered reprehensible
to do so. Shakespeare worked over the
Italian <i>novelle</i> of Boccaccio, weaving them into
his great English dramas, and nobody censured
him. It was this craving for romance that
overcame the delight in mere display and roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
interest not alone in the binding of a book but
in its contents. True collectors and book-fanciers
still strove with one another to obtain
choice, beautiful, and fabulously expensive volumes.
But for the most part the book came
back to its original purpose and took its place
as a mouthpiece of literature."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that books became cheap?"
asked Paul.</p>

<p>"Not what we should consider cheap&mdash;that
is, not for a long time. You see, the thing that
makes a book cheap is not alone the material
put into it, or the price for which it can be obtained
of the author; it is largely the size of
the edition printed that reduces the expense of
production. It is practically as much work to
print fifty copies of a volume as several hundred.
The labor of setting the type is the
same. The circle of readers was not large
enough in olden times to justify a volume being
manufactured in large numbers; nor were there
any methods for advertising and distributing
books broadcast as there are now."</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Paul, "I see. Of course
there weren't."</p>

<p>"Advertising and distribution play a very
important part in our present-day book trade,"
his father went on. "To-day publishers frequently
announce and advertise the book of a
well-known author before the manuscript is
completed, sometimes even before it is written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
at all. They get a scenario or résumé of the
story, and take orders for the book as if it were
really already finished. Or with the manuscript
in their hands they will often begin
'traveling it' long before it is printed. The
reason for this is that in a large country like
ours it takes a long time for salesmen to get
about and secure orders from the various
selling houses of our large cities. It means
spreading a book from coast to coast. While
the publisher is getting the book through the
press, correcting proof, having illustrations and
the colored jacket designed and printed, perhaps
having posters made for advertising, his
salesmen are taking orders for it by means of
a condensation of the story and a dummy cover
similar to the one which later will be put on the
volume. Then, when the books are ready, they
are shipped east and west, north and south,
but are not released for sale until a given date,
when all the stores begin selling them simultaneously.
You can see that this is the only fair
method, for it would be impossible, for example,
for San Francisco to advertise a book as new,
if it had been already selling in Boston for a
month or so. All the selling houses must have
the same chance. So a date of publication is
usually set and announced. Frequently, however,
long before that date an edition, or several
editions of a popular book will be sold out.
Booksellers will be so certain that they can dispose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of a great number of volumes that they
will place large orders ahead in order to be sure
of securing the books they desire."</p>

<p>"Can they always tell ahead what people will
want?" inquired Paul.</p>

<p>"No, not always. Sometimes the public will
be caught by a story and it will become popular
not only to the amazement of the bookseller,
but to the surprise of both publisher and author
as well. One cannot always prophesy what
readers will like, especially if an author is new.
It is a great gamble. But usually an author
whose work is known and liked can safely be
calculated upon to sell."</p>

<p>"Is it much work for a publisher to get a
book ready for the market after he once gets
the manuscript from the author?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"To produce a well-printed, artistic book requires
infinite care and pains," replied Mr.
Cameron. "Of course a book can be rushed
through. Such a thing is possible. But under
ordinary conditions it is several months,
sometimes a year, before the book is ready for
sale. First a galley proof of the manuscript
is made; by this I mean the subject matter is
printed on a long strip of paper about the width
of a page but several times as long. Then this
proof, which is made chiefly to be sure the type
is correctly set, is examined, and the errors in
it are rectified. After this it is again corrected
and is cut up into lengths suitable for a page.
Following this the page proof is printed, care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
being taken that the last word at the bottom of
one page joins on to the top word of the next.
It is very easy to omit a word and thus mar the
sense. It is also a rule of most publishing
houses that the top line of each page shall be
a full line, and in consequence it is often a
Chinese puzzle to make the text conform to the
rule. Readers often have to insert a line or
take one out to meet this necessity, and sometimes
an author's text is garbled as a result.
No writer likes having words or whole sentences
introduced or omitted; and you can't
quite blame him, either, for he has to stand behind
the book and receive not only what praise
it may win but also the blame showered on it
by both the public and the reviewers. Naturally
the book&mdash;not alone the story but the style
and choice of words&mdash;is assumed to be his.
If he is a careful worker he has probably
weighed every word that has gone into the
phrasing. He therefore does not relish having
his style meddled with, even for such a
technicality as the filling out of a short line."</p>

<p>"Is it really better to heed this printer's
edict?" laughed Paul.</p>

<p>"I think without question the book makes a
better appearance if the rule is heeded," declared
Mr. Cameron. "A printer does and
should take pride in the looks of his page. The
beauty of a book is quite an element in its production.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
After the type has been set up and
corrected, and the proof paged, the next consideration
is the size of the paper to be used, the
quality, the texture. The width of the margins,
the clearness or brilliancy of the text, the
appearance and flexibility of the binding all
have to do with the artistic result which is, or
should be, the aim of every publisher. When
all these details have been decided upon there
is yet another important factor in book-producing&mdash;the
item of expense. Books being no
longer the property of the few, they must be
within the reach of the many, and the book-manufacturer's
business is to make them so.
It is precisely because we have such a large
reading public that America has attained her
high intellectual average. Not that we are a
cultured nation. By no means. What I mean
is that our public school system offers education
so freely, and even compels it so drastically,
that there is a much smaller proportion
of illiterate persons here than in most lands.
Our illiterates are largely foreigners who have
not been in our country long enough to become
educated. Most of them have immigrated
from places where they had no educational
advantages, and some of them are, alas, now
too old to learn. The great part of our native-born
citizens can read and write, and vast
numbers of them have a much broader education
than that. It is by means of the wide distribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of learning and enlightenment that
we hope to banish ignorance and superstition
and spread patriotism and democracy. So you
see books are a giant element in our national
plan, and the writing and publishing of what
is worthy and helpful is a service to the country.
To do all this the publisher has no easy puzzle
to solve&mdash;to produce what is good literature
artistically, and at a price where he shall have
his legitimate profit, and yet give to the public
something within the range of its purse."</p>

<p>"I guess I'd rather stick to my job on the
<i>March Hare</i>!" exclaimed Paul.</p>

<p>"I imagine it is quite big enough for you at
present," smiled his father. "Between the
public, and the printer, and the bookbinder the
publisher is torn in many directions. And then
there is the author, who, as I say, does not like
his text tampered with. Firms differ greatly
about this. Some publishers feel perfectly justified
in going ahead and remodeling a writer's
work to suit themselves; others regard an
author's manuscript as a sacred possession and
never change so much as a punctuation mark
on it without asking permission. They may
suggest changes but they will not make them.
It is a point of honor with them not to do so."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron smoked reflectively.</p>

<p>"Authors, however," he went on, "are not
as badly off as they were before they had the
copyright. Their stories can no longer be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
stolen with impunity as in the past. They are
better paid, too. Many an olden-time author
received very scant remuneration for his labor;
sometimes he received none at all. Many had
to beg the patronage of the rich in order to get
their works printed; contracts were unfair
and publishers unprincipled. The unfortunate
author was the prey of vultures who
cheated him at every turn. Many died in extreme
poverty, only to become famous when it
was too late. In our day the law has revolutionized
most of these injustices, and although
there are still unprincipled publishers as there
are always scamps in every calling, the best
class houses deal honorably with their writers,
transforming the relation between author and
publisher into one of friendliness and confidence
rather than one of animosity and distrust."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is policy for a publisher to be
fair."</p>

<p>"It is more than policy; it is honesty," returned
Mr. Cameron. "It does, however, pay,
for without the writer the publisher could not
exist, and no writer is going to put his work in
the hands of a person he cannot trust. It is a
short-sighted man who kills the goose that lays
the golden egg!"</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">PAUL EMBARKS ON ANOTHER VENTURE</h3>


<p>"Do you know, Dad, the <i>March Hare</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
rapidly turning into an elephant," announced
Paul to his father one morning not long after
the conversation of the previous chapter. "I
am having more and more copy to prepare for
Mr. Carter all the time, and am doing every bit
of it by hand. It takes hours to get it ready.
I'm beginning to think I ought to have a typewriter.
How much does one cost? Have
you any idea?"</p>

<p>"Typewriters come at all prices," his father
answered. "What I should advise you to get
would be one of the small, light-weight machines.
They are far less expensive than the
others and do excellent work."</p>

<p>"About how much would one cost?"</p>

<p>"Fifty or sixty dollars."</p>

<p>Paul gave a low whistle.</p>

<p>"That's all very well, sir," he laughed.
"But where am I to get the fifty or sixty bones
to pay for it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, my boy. That's up to you.
Doesn't your business manager provide you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with a typewriter?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" replied Paul. "Much
as ever I can wring enough money out of him
to cover my incidental expenses. No, the paper
isn't fitting up offices for its hard-working
staff. If I get a typewriter it must be my own
venture."</p>

<p>"You would always find such a machine useful,"
returned his father slowly. "It would
not be money thrown away."</p>

<p>Paul glanced down thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to save up and get one,"
he said suddenly. "I could put my war-saving
stamps into it," he added.</p>

<p>"So you could."</p>

<p>"I have nearly twenty-five dollars' worth of
them already."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's fine! I had no idea you had
been so thrifty." Mr. Cameron looked pleased.</p>

<p>"We fellows have been racing each other up
at school to see who could get his book filled
first. I'm afraid it was not all thrift," Paul explained,
meeting his father's eyes with honesty.</p>

<p>"The result, however, seems to be the same,
whatever the motive," smiled the man.
"Twenty-five dollars would be a splendid start
toward a typewriter. You might possibly run
across a second-hand machine that had not
been much used and so get it for less than the
regular price. I think, considering the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
is such a worthy one, I might donate ten dollars
to it."</p>

<p>"Really! Oh, I say, Dad, that would be
grand. I'll pick you right up on your offer."</p>

<p>"You may, son. I shan't pay over my ten
dollars, though, until you have the rest of the
money."</p>

<p>"That's all straight; only don't forget about
it."</p>

<p>"You needn't worry. I don't expect you
will give me the chance to forget even if I
wanted to," replied his father teasingly.</p>

<p>"You bet I won't. I'm going right to work
to get the rest of my cash as fast as I can," responded
Paul. "And I'm going to look up
machines, too."</p>

<p>"I can give you the names of one or two good
makes," his father suggested.</p>

<p>"I wish you would, Dad. You think one of
the small machines you spoke of would be good
enough?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," assented Mr. Cameron. "Many
persons who do a good deal of work use the
little machines from preference. They take
up less room and are lighter and more compact
to carry about. In these days almost nobody
is without a typewriter, especially persons who
write to any considerable extent. Those who
write for publication find a typewriter practically
imperative. Editors will not fuss to decipher
hand-penned copy. The time it takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and the strain on the eyes are too great. A
professional writer must now turn in his manuscript
neatly typed and in good form if he expects
to have it meet with any attention. The
old, blotted, finely written and much marked-up
article is a thing of the past. Typewriters
are so cheap in these days and so simply constructed
that there is no excuse for people not
owning and running them."</p>

<p>"I wonder who thought out the typewriter,
Dad," mused Paul.</p>

<p>"That is a much mooted question, my boy,"
Mr. Cameron answered. "There is an old
British record of a patent for some such device
dated 1714, but the specifications regarding
it are very vague and unsatisfactory; there
also was an American patent taken out by
William A. Burt as early as 1829. Fire, however,
destroyed this paper and we have no positive
data concerning it. Since then there have
been over two thousand different patents on
the typewriter registered at the Government
Office at Washington,&mdash;so many of them that
any person applying for a patent on a new variety
must have a great deal of courage."</p>

<p>"I should say so!"</p>

<p>"Generally speaking, all typewriters resolve
themselves into two styles of keyboard machine:
in one the type bars strike the paper
when the keys are depressed; in the other the
type is arranged around a wheel which rotates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in answer to the depressing of a keyboard letter,
and prints the corresponding type which is
thereby brought opposite the printing point.
Either variety is good. It is a matter of preference.
Possibly the type-bar kind is the more
common. There is, too, a difference in the
manner of inking the type. One machine
inks the letters from an inked ribbon that is
drawn along by the action of the machine between
the type face and the paper; the type of
the other machine is inked from an ink pad that
strikes the type before it is brought in contact
with the paper. Sometimes this ribbon or
ink pad is black; sometimes blue, green, red, or
purple. Sometimes, too, a ribbon is so constructed
that it inks in two colors, which is frequently
a convenience for business purposes.
Text, for example, can be done in black and
the numerals&mdash;prices perhaps&mdash;put in in red."</p>

<p>"I see. I should think that would be fine,"
said Paul. "Now tell me one other thing: are
the letters arranged in the same order on all
typewriters?"</p>

<p>"You mean the keyboards?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess that is what I mean," replied
Paul.</p>

<p>"Keyboards sometimes differ in arrangement,"
Mr. Cameron explained. "Some keyboards
have a key for each letter, and others
one key for several characters. It is, however,
desirable that machines should differ as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
little in arrangement as possible, as typists
learn a universal method of letter-placing and
are consequently annoyed to find the letters in
an unfamiliar location on a new machine."</p>

<p>"I can see that would upset them dreadfully,"
answered Paul. "Of course they could
not go so fast."</p>

<p>"Not only that, but they would make frequent
mistakes," continued his father. "The
most expert typists seldom look at the keys, you
know. They memorize the position of the letters
and then operate the machine by the touch
system, or by feeling. You have often seen a
person play the piano in the same fashion. It
is a great advantage for a stenographer to be
able to do this, for he can keep his eyes on his
copy and not constantly change his eye-focus
by glancing first at the manuscript and then at
the machine. He can also give his entire attention
to taking dictation if he so desires.
The touch system is a great timesaver; it enables
any one to make twice the speed."</p>

<p>"And the bell warns them that they are approaching
the end of a line, even if they don't
see that they are," Paul added.</p>

<p>"Precisely!"</p>

<p>"It is a great scheme, isn't it&mdash;a typewriter?"
declared the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron nodded.</p>

<p>"What wouldn't the old monks have given
for one?" went on Paul mischievously. "Think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the years of work that would have saved
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true. But if we had no fine old
illuminated manuscripts, we would have lost
much that is beautiful and interesting. There
is no question, though, that typewriters accord
with our generation much more harmoniously
than do painfully penned manuscripts. In our
day the problem is to turn out the most work in
the shortest time, and the typewriter certainly
does that for us. It is a very ingenious device&mdash;a
marvel until one sees a modern printing
press; then the typewriter seems a child's toy,
a very elementary thing indeed."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see a big press sometime," Paul
observed. "I have been trying to get my
nerve together to ask Mr. Carter for a permit
to visit the <i>Echo</i> printing rooms."</p>

<p>"The <i>Echo</i>&mdash;humph!" laughed his father
in derision. "Why, my boy, much as we esteem
the <i>Echo</i> here in Burmingham, it is after
all only a small local newspaper and very insignificant
when compared with one of the big
city dailies. You should visit the press rooms
of a really large paper if you want to see something
worth seeing. The <i>Boston Post</i>, for example,
has the largest single printing press in
the world. It was built in 1906 by the Hoe
Company of New York and is guaranteed to
print, count, fold, and stack into piles over
700,000 eight-page papers an hour."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great Scott, Dad!"</p>

<p>"It is tremendous, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to see it."</p>

<p>"Sometime you shall. I think such a trip
could be arranged," his father replied. "In
the meantime I fancy you will have all you can
do to earn the money for your typewriter, purchase
it, and learn to manipulate it."</p>

<p>"I guess I shall; that's right," agreed Paul.
"How am I going to get together the rest of
that money! You haven't any suggestions,
have you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you want to do Thompson's
work while he takes his trip West. He is going
out to Indiana to see his mother and will be
away a month or so; in the meantime I have got
to hire another man to do the chores about the
place. The lawn must be cut; the leaves raked
up; the driveway kept trim and in order; and
the hedge clipped. If you want to take the job
I will pay you for it."</p>

<p>"I'd have to do the work Saturdays, I suppose."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't hurt you, would it?"</p>

<p>Paul thought a moment.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly it would interfere with your
school games, the football and baseball," said
his father. "Maybe a typewriter isn't worth
that amount of sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Think you want to make a try at Thompson's
job?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I won't hire in another man; only remember
I shall expect you to stick to the bargain.
I can't have you throwing up the place
in a week or two."</p>

<p>"I shan't do that."</p>

<p>"And I can't have my work done haphazard,
either," continued Mr. Cameron. "It must be
done well and regularly."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You want me to give you a trial?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dad."</p>

<p>"Do you want to do the whole job&mdash;the
brasses indoors too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I may as well take on the whole thing
since I am out for money," laughed Paul.</p>

<p>"That's right. You have the proper spirit&mdash;the
spirit that buys typewriters," answered
his father. "I don't believe the exercise will
hurt you, and at the end of it you will have
something more to show than a dislocated
shoulder, maybe, or a cracked cranium."</p>

<p>"Do you think I can earn what money I
shall need to make up the rest of my fifty dollars?"
inquired Paul anxiously. "Can I do it
in a month?"</p>

<p>"A month of work will give you the rest of
your fifty, son; have no fears. It will give
you, too, all the work you will want for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
while," answered Mr. Cameron. "Unless I
am greatly mistaken, you will be quite ready to
resign your post to Thompson when he comes
back."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall," Paul replied, "but if you
are repenting your bargain and are trying to
scare me off, Dad, it is too late. You have
hired me and I mean to stick it out."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, youngster, and good luck to
you!" chuckled his father.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">A DISASTER</h3>


<p>It was after Paul had toiled early and late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and put aside enough money for the new typewriter,
and even a little more, that the first
calamity befell the <i>March Hare</i>.</p>

<p>When the <a name="acounts" id="acounts"></a>accounts were found to be short,
it was unbelievable. Melville Carter, the business
manager, who handled all the funds, was
the soul of honesty as well as an excellent mathematician.
His books were the pride of the
editorial staff. Therefore when he was confronted
with the hundred-dollar deficit, he
could scarcely speak for amazement. There
must be some mistake, he murmured over and
over. He had kept the accounts very carefully,
and not an expenditure had been made that had
not been talked over first with the board and
promptly recorded. There never had been a
large surplus in the bank after the monthly
bills were paid, but there was always a small
margin for emergencies. The treasury had
never before gone stone dry. But there it was!
Not only was there no money in the bank, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the <i>March Hare</i> was about fifty dollars in the
hole.</p>

<p>Paul and Melville went over and over the accounts,
vainly searching for the error. But
there was no error. The columns seemed to
add up quite correctly. So, however, did the
deposit slips from the bank. And the tragedy
was that the two failed to agree. The bank
had a hundred dollars less to the credit of the
<i>March Hare</i> than the books said it should have.</p>

<p>In the meantime, at the bottom of Paul's
pocket, lay a bill of fifty dollars for publishing
expenses. What was to be done? The bill
must be paid. It would never do to let the
<i>March Hare</i> run behindhand. To begin to
run into debt was an unsafe and demoralizing
policy.</p>

<p>Paul's father had urged this advice upon him
from the first. The <i>March Hare</i> must pay its
bills as it went along; then its editors would
know where they stood. And so each month
the boys had plotted out their expenses and kept
rigidly within the amount of cash they had in
reserve. They had never failed once to have
sufficient money to meet their bills. In fact,
their parents had enthusiastically applauded
their foresight and business ability.</p>

<p>And now, suddenly and unaccountably, here
they were confronted by an empty treasury.
What was to be done?</p>

<p>Of course the bill was not large. Fifty dol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>lars
was not a tremendous sum. But when you
had not the fifty, and no way of getting it, the
amount seemed enormous.</p>

<p>Then there was the balking enigma of it.
How had it happened?</p>

<p>"If we only knew what we had done with
that hundred, it would not be so bad," groaned
Melville. "It makes me furious not to be able
to solve the puzzle."</p>

<p>"Me, too!" Paul replied gravely.</p>

<p>And worse than all was the humiliation of
finding they were not such clever business men
as they had thought themselves to be. That
was the crowning blow!</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars&mdash;think of it!" said Paul.
"If it had been twenty-five! But a cool hundred,
Mel!"</p>

<p>He broke off speechlessly.</p>

<p>"We can't be that amount short," protested
Melville for the twentieth time. "We simply
can't be. I have not paid one bill that the managing
board has not first O.K.-ed. You know
how carefully we have estimated our expenses
each month. We have kept a nest-egg in the
bank, too, all the time, in case we did get stuck.
I can't understand it. We haven't branched
out into any wild schemes. Of course, after
the party we did make those presents to the
school; but we looked over the ground and made
sure that we could afford to do so."</p>

<p>"We certainly thought we could," returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Paul glumly. "Probably, though, we were too
generous. Wouldn't people laugh if they
knew the mess we are in now!"</p>

<p>"Well, they are not going to know it from
me," growled Melville. "If I were to tell my
father we were in debt he would say it was
about what he expected. I wouldn't tell him
for a farm down East. And how the freshmen
would hoot!"</p>

<p>"I don't think my father would kid us," Paul
said slowly, "but I know he would be awfully
disappointed that we had made a business
foozle."</p>

<p>"I, for one, say we don't tell anybody," Melville
burst out. "I've some pride and I draw
the line at having every Tom, Dick, and Harry
shouting 'I told you so!' at me. What do you
say, Paul, that we keep this thing to ourselves?
If we have made a bull of it and got ourselves
into a hole, let's get out of it somehow without
the whole world knowing it."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Melville returned. "All I
know is I'm not for telling anybody."</p>

<p>"But this bill, Melville? What is to become
of that?"</p>

<p>"We must pay it."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i>?"</p>

<p>"You and I."</p>

<p>The room was very still; then Melville spoke
again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Haven't you any ready money, Paul?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;e&mdash;s."</p>

<p>"Have you enough so that we could halve a
hundred&mdash;pay the fifty-dollar deficit and put
fifty dollars in the bank?"</p>

<p>"You mean you'd pay half of it if I would?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;see."</p>

<p>"Could you manage it&mdash;fifty dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Could you, Mel?"</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't the fifty; but I have a Liberty
Bond that I could sell and get the money."</p>

<p>"That seems a shame," objected Paul.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care. I'm game. Anything
rather than having the whole school twit me of
messing the accounts."</p>

<p>"I don't care about being joshed, either," declared
Paul. "Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Something's fussing you. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Mel, I've been doing extra
work at home in order to earn enough money
for a typewriter. I've just got it saved up.
It'll have to go into this, now."</p>

<p>"Darned hard luck, old man! Don't do it if
you don't want to. Maybe I can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you can't! I wouldn't think of having
you pay the whole hundred, even if you had the
money right in your hand. This snarl is as
much mine as yours. We probably haven't
planned right. We've overlooked something
and come out short."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"We might let the bill run until another
month, I suppose," Melville presently suggested.</p>

<p>Paul started up.</p>

<p>"No. We mustn't do that on any account.
We might be worse off another month. I say
we clear the thing right up and start fair. If
you will turn in your fifty, I will," declared he,
with spirit.</p>

<p>"Bully for you! You sure are a sport, Kip."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything else to be done."</p>

<p>There was nothing else. Melville's "Baby
Bond" was converted into cash; Paul's typewriter
sacrificed; the fifty-dollar bill was paid;
and the other fifty was put into the bank.</p>

<p>The boys kept their own council and if the
<i>March Hare</i> sensed that its reputation had
trembled on the brink of ruin it gave no sign.
Gayly it went on its way.</p>

<p>People began to comment on the paper as being
"snappy" and "up to date"; they called it
"breezy" and "wholesome." Now and then
an appreciative note from a distant graduate
would make glad the editorial sanctum.
Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the magazine became
more and more the organ of speech for
the community. Persons who had never ventured
into print&mdash;who, perhaps, never would
have ventured&mdash;summoned up courage to send
to this more modest paper articles that were
received with welcome. Being first efforts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
words that their authors had long desired to
speak they were stamped with a freshness and
spontaneity that was delightful; if at times the
form was faulty it was more than compensated
for by the subject matter. Furthermore, many
of the contributions were of excellent quality.</p>

<p>Then there gradually came a day when the
timid <i>March Hare</i> had more desirable material
than it had room to print. A part of this was
political, for the school classes in current
events had aroused in the students a keen interest
in international affairs. As a consequence
good political articles had been eagerly
sought for. Other contributions were of scientific
nature and appeared from time to time in
the columns devoted to such matter. The
great mass of material sent in, however, was
unclassified and found its way into the department
labeled: <i>Town Suggestions</i>; or into the
pages known as: <i>Our Fathers and Mothers</i>.
Neither of these departments had originally
been featured in the <i>March Hare</i> plan; they
came as a natural outgrowth of the paper.
Parents had things which they wanted to say
to one another or to their boys and girls.
There was many a problem to be threshed out,
threshed out more intimately than it could have
been in a larger and more formal paper. The
questions debated never failed to interest the
elder part of Burmingham's population and
frequently they appealed to the youngsters as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
well. In fact, it was not long before these departments
were merged into a sort of forum
where an earnest and vigorous interchange of
opinions 'twixt young and old took place.</p>

<p>And all the while that the sprightly <i>March
Hare</i> was thus leaping on to success, Mr.
Arthur Presby Carter sat quietly in his office
and watched the antics of this youthful upstart.
He was surprised, very much surprised; indeed
he had, perhaps, never been more surprised in
all his life. He had long thought he knew a
good deal about the make-up of a paper,&mdash;what
would interest and what would not; in fact, he
considered himself an expert in that sphere.
He had put years of study into the matter.
Even now he would not have been willing to
confess that a seventeen-year-old boy had
taught him anything. That would have been
quite beneath his dignity. But privately he
could not deny that this schoolboy adventurer
had opened his eyes to a number of things he
had never considered before.</p>

<p>The <i>Echo</i> was a conservative, old-fashioned
paper that had followed tradition rather than
the lead of an alert, progressive public. From
a pinnacle of confident superiority it had spoken
to the people, telling them what they should
think, rather than giving ear to their groping
and clamoring desire for a hearing. The <i>Echo</i>
never discussed questions with its readers.
Its editor had never deigned to do so, so why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
should his publication? To bicker, argue, and
debate would have been entirely at odds with
its standards. People did not need to state
what opinions they held; they merely needed to
be told what opinions they should hold. Thus
thought Mr. Arthur Presby Carter, and thus
had his policy been immortalized in his paper.</p>

<p>But now, to his amazement and chagrin, a
publication had been born that was undermining
his prestige and putting to naught his creeds
and theories. This absurd <i>March Hare</i> was
actually becoming the authorized mouthpiece
of the town. It would have been blind not to
recognize the fact. Fools had indeed rushed in
where angels feared to tread, as Mr. Carter
himself had jeeringly asserted they sometimes
did, and as a result there had come into being
this unique monthly whose subscription list was
constantly swelling.</p>

<p>The publisher shrugged his shoulders. He
was a shrewd business man. He had, he confessed
to himself, been trapped into printing
this amateur thing, and once trapped he had
been game enough to live up to his contract; but
he had always viewed the new magazine with
a patronizing scorn. For a press of the <i>Echo's</i>
reputation to be printing a silly High School
publication had never ceased to be an absurdity
in his eyes. He had regarded the first issues
with derision. Then slowly his disdain had
melted into astonishment, respect, admiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
There evidently was a spirit in Burmingham of
which he had never suspected the existence,&mdash;an
intelligence, an open-mindedness, a searching
after truth. Hitherto the subscribers to
any paper had been represented in his mind by
a long list of names in purple ink, or else, by
their money equivalent. Now, suddenly, these
names became persons, voices, opinions. No
one could take up the <i>March Hare</i> and not be
conscious of a throbbing of hearts. It sounded
through every page&mdash;that beating of hearts&mdash;fathers,
mothers, girls, boys speaking with
simple sincerity of the things they held dearest
in their lives.</p>

<p>Why, it was a miracle, this living flesh and
blood that glowed so warmly and sympathetically
through the dead mediums of paper and
ink!</p>

<p>How had the enchantment been wrought? the
magnate asked himself. To be sure, he had
never tried through the columns of the <i>Echo</i>
to get into actual touch with those into whose
homes his paper traveled. He had never cared
who they were, what they thought, or how they
lived. The problems puzzling their brains
were nothing to him. But he now owned with
characteristic honesty that had he cared to obtain
from them this free expression of opinion
and learn the reactions their minds were constantly
reflecting, he would have been at a loss
as to how to proceed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet here, through the instrumentality of a
mere boy, a boy the age of his own son, the elusive
result had been accomplished!</p>

<p>Where lay the magic?</p>

<p>The <i>March Hare</i> was not a paper that could
speak with authority on any subject, nor was
it a magazine of distinct literary merit. On
the contrary it naïvely confessed that it was
young and did not know. It explained with
frankness that it had not the wisdom to speak;
that instead it merely echoed the thought of
its readers.</p>

<p>It was this "echoing idea" that was new to
Mr. Arthur Presby Carter. He had always
spoken. To listen to the opinions of others he
had considered tiresome. Very few persons
had opinions that were worth listening to.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, after dissecting the reasons for
the <i>March Hare's</i> popularity, and lopping off
the minor elements of its uniqueness and wide
appeal, the elder man faced the real psychological
secret of the junior paper's success: it listened
and did not talk; it was a dialogue instead
of a monologue,&mdash;an exact reversal of his policy.</p>

<p>Moreover, this dialogue, contrary to his previous
beliefs, presented amazingly interesting
opinions. Here were the past and the present
generation arguing on the policy of the new
America,&mdash;what its government, its statesmanship,
its ideals should be. The Past was rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in advice, experience; the Present in hope,
faith, courage. Youth, the citizen of to-morrow,
had a thousand theories for righting the
nation's faults; and some of these theories were
not wholly visionary.</p>

<p>Did his paper, Mr. Carter wondered, call out
in the hearts and minds of those who read it a
similar response of patriotism and high ideals?
Did it reach the great human <i>best</i> that lies deep
in every individual? Alas, he feared it did
not. It was too autocratic. It aimed not to
stimulate but to silence discussion and it probably
did so, descending upon its audience with a
confident finality that admitted of no argument.</p>

<p>The <i>March Hare</i>, on the other hand, was
apologetically modest. Nobody quailed before
it. Even the least of the intellectuals feared
not to lift up his voice in its presence and demand
a hearing.</p>

<p>Such a novel and rare product was worth perpetuating.
From a money standpoint alone the
paper might become in time a paying investment.
It was, of course, a bit crude at present;
but the kernel was there; so, too, was the long
list of subscribers,&mdash;an asset to which he was
not blind.</p>

<p>Suppose he was to buy out this schoolboy
enterprise at the end of the year and take it into
his own hands? Might it not be nursed into
a publication that would have a lasting place in
the community and become a property of value?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>He would improve it&mdash;that would go without
saying&mdash;touch it up and polish it; doubtless
he would think best to revise some of its
departments; and&mdash;well, he would probably
change its name and its cover design. He
could not continue to perpetuate such an absurdity
as that title. Perhaps he would christen
it the <i>Burmingham Monthly</i>.</p>

<p>The notion of purchasing the amateur product
appealed to his sense of humor. The more
he thought of it, the stronger became his desire
to own the paper. Strange he had never before
considered publishing a monthly magazine.
Yes, he would get out the few remaining issues
of the <i>March Hare</i> under its present name
and then he would buy out the whole thing for
a small sum and take it over. The boys would
undoubtedly be glad enough to sell it, flattered
to have the chance, no doubt. A check that
would provide the editorial staff with some
hockey sticks or tennis shoes would without
question satisfy them. What use would they
have for a paper after they graduated?</p>

<p>Thus reasoned Mr. Arthur Presby Carter to
himself in the solitude and silence of his editorial
sanctum. And after he had disposed of
the matter to his entire satisfaction, he took up
a letter from his desk and decided with the same
deliberation to purchase also certain oil properties
in Pennsylvania. For Mr. Arthur
Presby Carter was a man of broad financial in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>terests
and a large bank account. The Echo
was only one of his many business enterprises,
and buying <i>March Hares</i> or oil wells was all
one to him, a means of adding more dollars to
his accumulating hoard.</p>

<p>While Mr. Carter sat in his editorial office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and thus reflected on his many business ventures
Paul Cameron was also sitting in his editorial
domain thinking intently.</p>

<p>The hundred-dollar deficit in the school
treasury bothered him more than he was willing
to admit. It was, of course, quite possible
for him to repair the error&mdash;for he was convinced
an error in the <i>March Hare's</i> bookkeeping
had caused the shortage. A bill of a hundred
dollars must have been paid and not recorded.
Melville Carter had never had actual
experience in keeping accounts, therefore was
it so surprising that he had inadvertently made
a mistake? Perhaps he was not so capable of
handling money and keeping it straight as the
class had thought when they had elected him
to his post of business manager. Paying bills
and rigorously noting down every expenditure
was no easy task. It was a thankless job, anyway&mdash;the
least interesting of any of the positions
on the paper, and one that entailed more
work than most. To kick at Mel would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
rank ingratitude. It was not likely he had
made a mess of things wittingly. Therefore
the only alternative, since neither Mel's pride
nor his own would permit them to confess to
the muddle, was to pay the outstanding bill and
slip the rest of the cash as quietly as possible
into the bank.</p>

<p>How strange it was that the sum lacking was
just an even hundred dollars! Yet after all,
was it so strange? It was so easy to make a
mistake of one figure in adding and subtracting
columns. There did not, it was true, seem
to be any mistake on the books; but of course
there was a mistake somewhere. It was not at
all likely that the bank had made the error.
Banks never made mistakes. Well, there was
no use crying over spilled milk. The success
of the <i>March Hare</i> had been so phenomenal
hitherto that one must put up with a strata of
ill luck.</p>

<p>He hated to give up buying his typewriter,
after all the hard work he had done to earn it.
He supposed he could sell his Liberty Bond as
Melville was planning to do and use that money
instead of the sum he had laid by. But he did
not just know how to go to work to convert a
Liberty Bond into cash. It was an easy enough
matter to buy a bond; but where did you go to
sell one? How many business questions there
were that a boy of seventeen was unable to answer!
If he were to ask his father how to sell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the bond, it might arouse suspicion, to ask anybody
else might do so too. People would wonder
why he, Paul Cameron, was selling a Liberty
Bond he had bought only a short time before.
Burmingham was a gossipy little town.
Its good news traveled fast but so also did its
bad news. Any item of interest, no matter how
small, was rapidly spread from one end of the
village to the other. Therefore Paul could not
risk even making inquiries, let alone selling his
property to any one in the place.</p>

<p>Yet he could not but laugh at the irony of the
signs that confronted him wherever he went:
<i>Buy Bonds!</i> <i>Invest!</i> There were selling
booths at the bank, the library, the town hall.
At every street corner you came upon them.
But none of these agencies were purchasing
bonds themselves. Nowhere did it say: <i>Sell
Bonds!</i> These patriots were not at their posts
to add to their troubles&mdash;not they!</p>

<p>Once it occurred to Paul to ask the cashier
at the bank what people did with Liberty Bonds
which they wanted to dispose of; but on second
thought he realized that Mr. Stacy was an intimate
friend of his father's and might mention
the incident. Therefore he at length dismissed
the possibility of selling his bond and
thereby meeting his share of the <i>March Hare</i>
deficit.</p>

<p>No, he must use his typewriter money.
There was no escape. He chanced to be at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
<i>Echo</i> offices that day with copy for the next issue
of his paper and was still rebelliously wavering
over the loss of his typewriter when the
door of Mr. Carter's private room opened and
the great man himself appeared, ushering out
a visitor. Glancing about on his return from
the elevator his eye fell on Paul.</p>

<p>"Ah, Paul, good afternoon," he nodded.
"Come into my office a moment. I want to
speak to you."</p>

<p>Paul followed timidly. It was seldom that
his business brought him into personal touch
with Mr. Carter, toward whom he still maintained
no small degree of awe; usually the affairs
relative to the school paper were transacted
either through the business manager of
the <i>Echo</i> or with one of his assistants.</p>

<p>But to-day Mr. Carter was suddenly all amiability.
He escorted Paul into his sanctum,
and after closing the door, tipped back in the
leather chair before his desk and in leisurely
fashion drew out a cigar.</p>

<p>"How is your paper coming on, Paul?" he
asked, as he blew a cloud of smoke into the room
and surveyed the boy through its blueness.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Carter."</p>

<p>"Austin, our manager, tells me your circulation
is increasing."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It's gone up steadily from the
first."</p>

<p>"Humph!" mused Mr. Carter. "Funny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
thing, isn't it? It was quite a clever move of
yours to set the parents to writing. Everybody
likes to see himself in print; we're a vain
lot of creatures. Of course, the minute you
published their articles they bought them.
Could not resist it!"</p>

<p>The lad laughed. Although he did not
wholly agree with the editor it did not seem
necessary to tell him so.</p>

<p>"I guess you've found your enterprise a
good deal of work," went on Carter.</p>

<p>"Well, yes. It has taken more time than I
expected," Paul admitted.</p>

<p>"You'll be glad to get rid of it when you
graduate in June."</p>

<p>The man studied the boy furtively.</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall. It has been great fun; but it
has been a good deal of care."</p>

<p>"You're going to Harvard, I hear."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Harvard was Dad's college, and
it's going to be mine."</p>

<p>"I haven't much use for colleges," growled
Mr. Carter. "They turn out nothing but a
grist of extravagant snobs. I never went to
college myself and I have contrived to pull
along and make my pile, thanks to nobody.
I've a big half mind to have Melville do the
same. But his mother wants him to go, and
I suppose I shall have to give in and let him.
It will be interesting to see what he gets out of
it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul did not answer. He did not just know
what reply to make.</p>

<p>"So you're set on college."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am."</p>

<p>"What's your idea?"</p>

<p>"To know something."</p>

<p>The man's thin lips curled into a smile.</p>

<p>"And you expect to acquire that result at
Harvard?"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"Well, you may," remarked Mr. Carter, with
a sceptical shrug of his shoulders, "but I doubt
it. You will probably fritter away your time
and your father's money in boat-racing, football,
and fraternity dramatics; that is what it
usually amounts to."</p>

<p>"It has got to amount to more than that with
me," Paul declared soberly.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because Dad is not rich, and hasn't the
money to throw away."</p>

<p>A silence fell upon the room.</p>

<p>"I should think that under those circumstances
you would do much better to cut out a
frilly education and go to work after you finish
your high school course," observed the magnate
deliberately. "Suppose I were to make
you a good business offer? Suppose I were to
take over that school paper of yours at the end
of June&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait a moment. Then suppose I took you
in here at a good salary and let you keep on with
this <i>March Hare</i> job? Not, of course, in precisely
its present form but along the same general
lines. We could make a paying proposition
out of that paper, I am sure of it. It
would need a good deal of improving," continued
the great man in a pompous, patronizing
tone, "but there is an idea there that could be
developed into something worth while, unless
I am very much mistaken."</p>

<p>"B&mdash;u&mdash;t&mdash;" stammered Paul and then
stopped helplessly.</p>

<p>"The thing is not worth much as it now
stands," went on Mr. Carter, puffing rings of
smoke airily toward the ceiling, "but in time
we could remodel it into a publication of real
merit&mdash;make a winner of it."</p>

<p>Paul did not speak.</p>

<p>"How do you like newspaper work?" inquired
Mr. Carter, shifting the subject adroitly.</p>

<p>"Very much&mdash;the little I've seen of it."</p>

<p>"If you were to come in here you might work
up to a place on the <i>Echo</i>."</p>

<p>The boy started.</p>

<p>"You're a bright chap and I like you. I'd
see you had a chance if you made good."</p>

<p>"You're very kind, sir, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, out with it! What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"It would knock my college career all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Faugh! College career! Why, here is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
career worth ten of it&mdash;the chance of a lifetime.
I wouldn't offer it to every boy. In
fact, I wouldn't offer it to any other boy I
know of&mdash;not to my own son."</p>

<p>"It's very good of you, Mr. Carter."</p>

<p>"See here, youngster," said Mr. Carter, leaning
toward Paul impressively, "when you are
as old as I am you will learn that you've got to
take opportunities when they come to you.
The same one never comes twice. You don't
want to turn down a thing of this sort until
you've considered it from all sides. Think
what it would mean to remodel that paper of
yours with plenty of money behind you and put
it on a footing with other professional magazines.
That would be a feather in your cap! I
could buy the <i>March Hare</i> in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure you could, Mr. Carter," replied
Paul slowly. "The staff might not want
to sell it."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>The tone was incredulous with surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't know that we fellows would feel that
we had the moral right to sell out," explained
Paul quietly. "You see, although we have
built up the paper it belongs to a certain extent
to the school."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cut in Mr. Carter impatiently.
"That's absurd! The publication was your
idea, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at the beginning it was; but&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"They wouldn't have had it but for you,
would they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; perhaps not," confessed the
boy reluctantly.</p>

<p>"It was your project," insisted Carter.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then nobody has any right to claim it."</p>

<p>"Maybe not the right to really claim it.
But all of us boys have slaved together to make
it a success. It is as much their work as mine."</p>

<p>"What do they intend to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Pass it on to the school, I suppose. We
haven't talked it over, though. We haven't
got that far yet."</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is that if you handed it
over to the school free of charge you would be
darn stupid. Why not make some money out
of it? Offer to sell it to the school if you think
you must; but don't give it away."</p>

<p>Paul shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>"The school couldn't buy it. They've
nothing to buy it with."</p>

<p>"Then you have a perfect right to sell it to
somebody else," put in Mr. Carter quickly.
"In the world of business, people cannot expect
to get something for nothing. What you
can't pay for you can't have. If the school has
no money&mdash;" he broke off with a significant
gesture. "Now if I offered you fellows a
lump sum in June&mdash;a sum you could divide
amongst you as you saw fit&mdash;wouldn't that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
be a perfectly fair and legitimate business
deal?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" faltered Paul.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it?" Mr. Carter persisted.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," murmured Paul unwillingly.
"Only, you see, I still feel that the paper should
go to the school. I think the other fellows
would feel so too."</p>

<p>Nettled Mr. Carter rose and strode irritably
across the room and back. Then he came to a
standstill before Paul's chair and looked down
with steely eyes into the lad's troubled face.</p>

<p>"But you admitted just now that you and the
staff had made the paper what it is, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then it belongs to you, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"In a certain sense; yes."</p>

<p>"Now see here, Paul," began Mr. Carter.
"You are the editor-in-chief of that magazine,
and the head of the bunch. What you say
would go with them&mdash;or it ought to. You
could make them think about what you pleased.
Why don't you put it up to your staff to sell the
paper to me and pocket the proceeds?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guess you could manage to think as I
wanted you to if it were worth your while,
couldn't you?" smiled the great man insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"I don't quite&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Turn it over in your mind. It is a straight
business proposition. You land your <i>March
Hare</i> here in my office as my property at the
end of June, and I will make it worth your
while. Understand?" The great man eyed
the lad keenly.</p>

<p>"Not fully, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"But you would before I got through with
you," chuckled Mr. Carter, rising.</p>

<p>Paul rose too. He was very glad to have the
interview finished.</p>

<p>"We'll talk no more about this matter to-day,"
declared the editor lightly. "You think
over carefully what I've said and come and see
me again sometime."</p>

<p>"All right, sir."</p>

<p>Paul moved awkwardly toward the door.
He wanted to add some word to conceal how
worried, angry, and upset he really was, but
he could think of nothing to say. It was ignominious
to pass out of the room as if he were
a whipped puppy. Men always terminated
their business talks pleasantly, no matter how
vexed they were with one another underneath.</p>

<p>He must show Mr. Carter that he also could
close an interview in true man's fashion. His
hand was on the knob of the door now; but he
turned.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, Mr. Carter," he said with
an off-hand air, "do you know where a person
goes to sell a Liberty Bond?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the only topic of conversation he could
think of.</p>

<p>"Sell one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The boy blushed.</p>

<p>"In need of cash?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;yes; I'm thinking of getting rid of a
fifty-dollar bond I have."</p>

<p>"That's foolish. You'd much better keep
it."</p>

<p>Paul shook his head with sudden resolve.</p>

<p>"I think if I can get rid of it without too
much red tape, I'll let it go."</p>

<p>"Want the money badly, eh?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;e&mdash;s."</p>

<p>"Your father know you are selling out?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>The boy began to regret that he had spoken.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ho! So you're in a scrape, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, it's not a scrape," protested Paul.
"At least, not what you'd commonly call a
scrape. It is just that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you do not want to tell your father."</p>

<p>"Not now."</p>

<p>Mr. Carter winked.</p>

<p>"I see," he said.</p>

<p>He went to a drawer in his desk and innocently
Paul watched his movements, wondering
what he was going to do. Give him an address
where he could sell his bond, no doubt.</p>

<p>Instead Mr. Carter slipped a crisp bill from
a roll in the drawer and held it toward him.</p>

<p><a name="q137" id="q137"></a>"But I can't take your money, Mr. Carter,"

waving him off. "Call it a loan if you
prefer. A loan with a bond for security is
quite an ordinary business matter. It is only
a trifle, anyway."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Run along! I have no more time to give
to you. I have a directors' meeting at four.
Ah, here's Mr. Dalton now. How are you,
Dalton. Run along, youngster. Take the
cash with you and welcome." Then he added
in an undertone: "Just use your influence with
your chums up at school, and we will say no
more about this little loan. If you land the
<i>March Hare</i> in my hands the deal will be worth
the fifty to me. Good night."</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">TEMPORIZING</h3>


<p>It was not until Paul was on his way home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
that the full significance of Mr. Carter's action
dawned upon him. He, Paul Cameron, had
been bribed! He had taken from the magnate
of Burmingham a sum of money in return for
which he had tacitly pledged himself to use his
influence to carry through a business deal which
he held to be wrong, and with which he had no
sympathy. To be sure, he had not done this
monstrous deed voluntarily. Mr. Carter had
thrust it upon him. He had been put in a
difficult position and had failed to act. It was
his passivity for which he now blamed himself.
He should have repudiated the whole thing,
hurled the odious money upon Carter's desk&mdash;since
the man refused to take it back&mdash;and
fled from the place. The fact that Mr. Carter
had given him no opportunity to discuss the
matter or refuse his offer was no excuse. He
should have made the opportunity himself.</p>

<p>The only apology he could offer for his conduct
was that he was completely stunned by
the happenings of the afternoon. The drama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
had moved too swiftly for him. Until it was
over, he had not sensed its trend. Was he
really so much to blame?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, twist and excuse the fact as
he would, the truth remained that there he was
with the hateful fifty-dollar bill in his possession.</p>

<p>It was appalling, terrible! He, who had always
prided himself on his honesty! He had
not had the least notion of precipitating such a
crisis when he had inquired about selling his
Liberty Bond. The query had been a purely
innocent one. He had to say something, and
the chance of getting information from Mr.
Carter had seemed too opportune to let slip.
But as he reviewed the episode of the past half
hour, he saw that Mr. Carter was perfectly
justified in misunderstanding him and thinking
that he laid himself open to the very situation
that had come about.</p>

<p>Paul fingered the bill nervously. Fifty dollars!
If he chose to use it to meet the deficit
on the school paper he could now take his own
savings for the new typewriter he wanted so
much. Who would be the wiser? Had not
Mr. Carter given him the money? It was his,
his own property.</p>

<p>To forfeit that typewriter had been a wrench.
He had not dared to admit to himself how bitter
had been his disappointment at giving it
up. It would be a long time before he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
ever again earn enough money to buy a machine.
And he needed it so much&mdash;needed it
right away. Suppose he did buy a typewriter
next year? A dozen typewriters would never
mean to him what one would mean just now.
Until he had made up his mind to do without
it, it had seemed an indispensable possession,
and now the necessity of having it came back
again with redoubled force. He reflected on
the machine's myriad advantages. Wasn't it
almost imperative that he buy one? Wasn't
such a thing for the welfare of the school?
Surely it would not be a selfish action if he expended
his money for the good of others.</p>

<p>Suppose he were to urge the fellows to sell
out the <i>March Hare</i> to Carter? After all, they
were their own masters. They need not do so
unless they chose. He had no authority over
them. To advise was a very different thing
from commanding. No matter what measure
he advocated, his opinion was neither final nor
mandatory. He was no autocrat or imperator
before whose decree his subjects trembled. It
would be absurd to credit himself with such
power.</p>

<p>And, anyway, the editorial board had never
promised to bequeath the <i>March Hare</i> to the
school. If parents, teachers, pupils, the general
public had assumed this, they had had no
right to do so. The paper, as Mr. Carter had
said, was the property of those who had created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
it. Were they not free to dispose of it as they
chose?</p>

<p>Yet all the while he argued thus, Paul knew,
deep down in his soul, that although there had
been no written or verbal agreement, the community
considered the publication a permanent
school property.</p>

<p>Should it be sold to Mr. Carter and continue
to be published, what chances for success would
another such paper have? It would be useless
for 1921 to attempt to duplicate the <i>March
Hare</i>. People were familiar with it; they
knew and liked it. In all probability a great
portion of its regular subscribers would continue
to take the magazine, regardless of who
published it. That it had ceased to be a school
enterprise would not influence them. They
liked it for what it was, not as a philanthropy.
Probably, too, with Mr. Carter behind it, the
<i>March Hare</i> would branch out and be made
much more attractive. If the <i>Echo</i> press took
up the publication of such a monthly, it would,
of course, be with the intention of sweeping all
other competitors out of the field. It <i>would</i>
sweep them out, too. Mr. Carter would see to
that. By fair means or foul he had always
accomplished that which he willed to do.</p>

<p>Another school paper running in opposition
to such a power? Why, it would not have the
ghost of a chance to live! Besides, who would
print it? No, if Mr. Carter took over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
<i>March Hare</i>, the school must say good-by to
further literary attempts.</p>

<p>But after all, was that his lookout? What
concern of his would it be what became of
Burmingham and 1921. They could struggle
on as best they might. That was what his class
had had to do.</p>

<p>Paul walked home very slowly, turning Mr.
Carter's bill in his hand as he went. How delicate
its workmanship! How wonderful its
dainty tracery! He had never before noticed
the accuracy with which a bill was fashioned.</p>

<p>"Who prints United States money, Dad?"
he asked quite irrelevantly of his father, when
next he saw him.</p>

<p>"Our United States greenbacks? Those
are engraved and printed, my son, at the
United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing
at Washington. They are made from very
fine and exquisitely prepared plates and printed
on a special sort of paper. This paper has
numberless little silk threads running through
it which not only toughen it and prevent it
from tearing but also make it almost impossible
to duplicate. A counterfeiter would have
to go to a deal of trouble to imitate such
material."</p>

<p>Paul nodded. He had noticed the blue
threads in his fifty-dollar bill. In fact, there
was not much about it that he had not noticed
while twisting and turning it in his fingers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," continued his father, "our paper
money and government notes are fine examples
of accurate and perfect workmanship.
I suppose, as they pass through our hands, we
seldom consider the labor that goes into making
them. From the time the designer begins
his work to the moment the plates are made,
tried out, and accepted, many, many hours of
toil are consumed. You know, of course, that
our government runs a very extensive printing
plant where it uses tons of paper every year.
There is no end to the government printing.
The Congressional Records must be printed
and filed, as must also thousands of reports
from various boards and committees. Then
there is stationery for official use; official documents
of all sorts; catalogues; cards for government
business."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. Uncle Sam runs quite a jobbing
office, all the details of which must be
carefully systematized, too. Great care is
taken that the spelling abbreviations and such
details shall be uniform on all government documents.
You can readily see how necessary
it is that they should be. Therefore the government
issues a manual for the use of its employees,
a list of punctuation and capitalization
marks and rules, as well as printers' marks
which shall serve as a standard and must be
conformed to for all government purposes."</p>

<p>"That is interesting, isn't it?" murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Paul.</p>

<p>"You can readily understand that in preparing
government reports and such things for the
press a uniform abbreviation for the States,
for example, must be used. It would be out of
the question to have one person abbreviating
Alabama one way and another person another.
It would not only result in a slipshod lot of
documents but the variation might mislead
those who read it. In all such documents every
detail must be the same. Moreover, often employees
are far from being expert in such matters
and a book to which they can refer is a
great help to them. In addition, it settles all
disputes arising between the clerks who make
up the reports and the printers who print them;
and it saves the time and labor of correcting
errors."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"Not only does the government printing
office do a vast amount of printing for the use
of the Washington authorities but it does a
great deal of work for the country at large.
Think, for instance, of the care and accuracy
that goes into making out the United States
census."</p>

<p>"Not only care but paper and ink," laughed
Paul.</p>

<p>"All such tabulated documents consume
quantities of paper," answered his father.
"Directories, telephone books, circulars, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
advertising matter in general demand tons and
tons of paper every year, and the printing of
them provides employment for hundreds of
printers. As time goes on, more and more
business is annually transacted by mail. The
country is so tremendous and the expense of
sending out salesmen to cover it so great that
merchants now do much of their selling from
mail-order catalogues. Many of these books
are very attractive, too. A careful reproduction
of the object for sale is made and the photograph
sent broadcast to speak for itself. Jewelry
firms issue tempting lists of their wares;
china and glass dealers try to secure buyers
by offering alluring pages of pictures, many of
them in color; dry goods houses send out photographs
of suits, hats, and clothing of all sorts.
You have seen scores of such books and know
how they are indexed and priced. In fact,
there are commercial firms whose mail-order
department is a business in itself, catalogues
entirely supplanting salesmen. It is a much
cheaper, wider-reaching means of selling, and
often the results are quite as good as are the
more old-fashioned methods. Now that artistic
cuts can be reproduced with comparatively
little expense this means of advertising is becoming
more and more popular. Many charities
annually make their appeal for funds by
leaflet or card; stocks are offered to customers;
your patronage to theaters, entertainments, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hotels is thus solicited. The combination of
low postage rates and wide mail distribution
is accountable for an almost overwhelming
amount of printed business being transacted.
Then, too, the mail is a great time-saver, or
should be, an advantage to be considered in our
busy, work-a-day world."</p>

<p>"But people don't read half the stuff they
get through the mails," said Paul.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. If they did, they would
do little else," smiled his father. "Nevertheless,
they glance at it and now and then, as their
eye travels over it, an item on the page catches
their fancy. Any artistic advertisement will
usually command attention; so will the receipt
of some trifling article that is pretty or novel.
Besides, it is chiefly the rushed city person who
tosses the advertisement away unread. Those
with more leisure, country people, perhaps, who
receive little mail, usually read every word of
the printed matter that reaches them. They do
not have so many diversions as we do, and this
printed stuff entertains them and keeps them in
touch with the cities. Therefore they generally
go over what is sent them quite carefully.
Frequently they are miles from large shops and
are forced to do much of their purchasing by
mail, so such catalogues are a great convenience
to them."</p>

<p>"I can see that," Paul admitted.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. Catalogues to those living in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
sparsely settled districts are a profound blessing.
I should not be surprised to see the
paper, ink, and printing business one of our
largest industries. We cannot do without
any of these commodities. Have you thought,
for example, of the amount of material and
labor that goes into producing the millions of
thick telephone directories annually circulated
among the subscribers? All these have to be
printed somewhere."</p>

<p>"It must be an awful piece of work to get
them out, Dad."</p>

<p>"It is. They must be printed absolutely correctly
too, for an error will cause both the exchange
and the subscriber no end of trouble.
So it is with residence directories and many
similar lists. If you consider, you can readily
see that as a nation we consume an unbelievable
amount of paper and ink in a year. That is
why the shortage of these materials during the
war caused such universal inconvenience.
And not only do we demand a great deal of paper,
and ink, and printer's skill in every department
of our business, but being a country alert
for education, we annually use a tremendous
number of schoolbooks. Hundreds, thousands,
millions of schoolbooks are printed each
year for the purpose of educating and democratizing
our growing citizens."</p>

<p>Paul stirred in his chair uneasily. The talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
had drifted back into the familiar channels of
the present. Again the school, Mr. Carter, the
fifty-dollar bill, and the thoughts that for the
instant had taken flight now returned to his
mind, bringing a cloud to his face.</p>

<p>His father, noticing the shadow, looked
kindly into the boy's eyes.</p>

<p>"You are tired to-night, son," he said.</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Not working too hard?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Everything going all right at school?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Paper still booming?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dad. Going finely."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron waited a second. A wild impulse
to take his father into his confidence
seized Paul. He hesitated. Then it was too
late. His father rose and with a friendly touch
on his shoulder strode across the hall and into
his den.</p>

<p>"You must not overwork at your editorial
desk, my boy," he called jocosely from the distant
threshold. "It doesn't pay."</p>

<p>Paul heard the door slam. The moment for
confession had passed. His father had gone
and he was alone with his conscience and Mr.
Carter's fifty-dollar bill.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE CAMERONS HAVE A VISITOR</h3>


<p>During the next week Paul was obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
go several times to the <i>Echo</i> offices and each
time he went with the secret hope that he would
see Mr. Carter and have the opportunity to
hand back to him the hateful money that burned
in his breast pocket. The chance, however,
never came. The door of the great man's private
room was continually closed and when the
boy suggested to the clerk that he wait and talk
with the publisher, he was told that Mr. Carter
was engaged and could see no one that day.
The thought of mailing the money occurred to
Paul, but as this method of returning it seemed
precarious and uncertain, he promptly abandoned
the idea. For the same reason he was
unwilling to leave the bill in a sealed envelope
to be delivered to the editor-in-chief by one of
the employees. Should a sum so immense, at
least so immense in the lad's estimation, be lost,
he never could replace it. Certainly he was in
trouble enough already without chancing another
dilemma.</p>

<p>In the meantime he carried the bill around
with him, trying in the interval to decide what
to do with it. Gradually he became accustomed
to having the money in his possession. It did
not seem so strange a thing now as it had in the
beginning. After all, fifty dollars was not
such a vast sum. To a person of Mr. Carter's
wealth it probably was nothing at all, an
amount too trifling to cause a second thought.
Besides, he had not really bound himself to
Mr. Carter. He had not actually guaranteed
to do anything. It was Mr. Carter who had
insisted that he take the money.</p>

<p>Unquestionably in exchange for it Paul was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
expected to use his influence to persuade the
boys of 1920 to sell their paper; still, using
one's influence did not necessarily mean that
one must succeed. If he suggested the deal
and it failed to go through, would he not have
done all that was required of him? Mr. Carter
had stipulated nothing more than that he
use his influence. If the <i>Echo</i> owner had over-estimated
the power of that influence, was not
that his lookout? No doubt such an understanding
was quite customary in business circles
and was not so important a matter as he
took it to be.</p>

<p>The more the lad thought the matter over
the more plausible the retention of the money
seemed. To use one's influence was surely a
legitimate arrangement. It was done in politics
every day of the week. Weren't individuals
in high positions constantly accepting tips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to put through business measures of one sort
or another, regardless of whether they personally
approved of them or not? To be sure, he
had heard his father call such money <i>bribe
money</i>, <i>dirty money</i>, and refer to the men who
took it as being <i>bought up</i>.</p>

<p>Paul knew his father scorned such proceedings.
That was the reason he had lost the campaign
when running for mayor against Mr.
Carter in 1915. It had been an underhanded
fight and almost everyone in Burmingham, regardless
of party, had thought so. Mr. Carter
had won the election, it is true, but it had been
at the expense of the respect of the entire community.</p>

<p>And now he, Paul Cameron, was deserting
the principles for which his father stood and
was accepting those of his opponent. Plainly
speaking, that was what the thing amounted
to. He was taking money for something he
disapproved of doing; he was being a traitor to
his class, to his friends, to the school. The
boys on the staff of the paper respected and
trusted him. They would never suspect him of
treachery. Should he stand up and advocate
the sale of the <i>March Hare</i> he knew his word
would have weight. If, on the other hand, he
manfully presented Mr. Carter's offer as it honestly
should be presented, he was practically
sure that the measure would be voted down.</p>

<p>Yet if he returned the money to Mr. Carter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and refused to have anything further to do with
the affair, he must forfeit his typewriter, the
thing on which he had set his heart.</p>

<p>What an unlucky snarl it was! How unfortunate
that the <i>March Hare's</i> bank account
should have been muddled and its editor driven
to repair an error that was not his! Had not
this occurred, all would have gone smoothly and
he could have thrust the odious money back in
Mr. Carter's face and left his office a free man.
He hated Mr. Carter, the <i>March Hare</i>, the
school, and all the web of circumstances in
which he was entangled! He wanted that
typewriter. It seemed as if he must have it.
In the meantime, the May issue of the school
paper came out and preparations for the June
number, the last that 1920 would publish, began.
The swift passing of the days forced
Paul's hand. Whichever way he was to act he
must act soon now, and he found himself no
nearer a decision than he had been two weeks
ago. He still had Mr. Carter's money in his
pocket, and he was still eyeing the Corona he
longed for and which he could neither bring
himself to purchase nor give up; he was, too,
quite as unreconciled to doing his Alma Mater
an injury as he had been before. Round and
round in a circle he went, the same old arguments
bringing him to the same old conclusions.
There seemed to be no way out.</p>

<p>While he was still pondering what he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
do, an interesting visitor arrived at the Cameron
home. This was Mr. Percy Wright, a
college classmate of Paul's father and the
owner of one of the largest paper mills in the
State. He was a man of magnetic personality
and wide business experience and Paul instantly
conceived that warm admiration for him
which a younger boy will often feel for an
older man.</p>

<p>A fund of amusing anecdotes rippled from
Mr. Wright's tongue. It seemed as if there
was no subject on which he could not converse.
He had an entertaining story about almost
every topic suggested and kept the entire Cameron
family laughing heartily through each
meal. Paul watched the stranger with fascinated
eyes. How charming he was, how witty,
how clever! And yet Mr. Wright was not always
jesting. On the contrary, he could be
very serious when his hobby of paper-making,
with its many interdependent industries, was
mentioned.</p>

<p>He was, for example, in close touch with the
publication of periodicals, newspapers, and
books, and he immediately hailed Paul as a
colleague.</p>

<p>"So you are the editor-in-chief of a widely
circulated monthly magazine, are you, my
boy?" he remarked. "Well, you certainly
have an enviable job. It is a pity you are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
going to keep on with the work. Your father
tells me he thinks you have made a great success
of it."</p>

<p>Paul colored uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Not that I would have you throw over your
college career," added Mr. Wright quickly.
"Not for a moment! But publishing work is
so alluring! I have always wanted to own a
newspaper and I have not yet given up hope of
doing so before I die."</p>

<p>"My paper isn't anything wonderful," said
Paul modestly.</p>

<p>"But it is a clean, good magazine of its sort.
I have been looking over several copies of it
since I have been here. You have nothing to
be ashamed of. I call the <i>March Hare</i> a
mighty fine little publication. It's a splendid
starter and I'll be bound has given you some
excellent experience. Every paper has to have
a beginning. All our big newspapers began on
a small scale. There is some difference between
one of our modern Sunday issues and the
<i>Boston News-Letter</i> of long ago."</p>

<p>"I don't think I know what the <i>Boston
News-Letter</i> was," Paul said.</p>

<p>"You've never seen a copy of this early
Massachusetts newspaper?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a small, four-page sheet,
printed in old type, and filled to a great extent
with announcements of merchandise that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
been shipped from England to the colonies for
sale: pipes of wine, bolts of homespun, pieces
of silk, consignments of china. Such things
came from overseas in those days, and the arrival
of the vessels that brought them was eagerly
awaited by prospective purchasers, for
there were few luxuries in the New World.
Along with these advertisements was printed
the news of the day; and that all this matter
could be contained in four small pages proves
how uneventful was early Massachusetts history.
Now and then some great event would
command more space. I recall seeing one
copy of the paper with a picture of the first
steam locomotive&mdash;a crude, amusing picture it
was, too. Later the <i>Massachusetts Gazette</i>
appeared, and soon afterward there were other
papers and other printers scattered throughout
the respective States. Benjamin Franklin was
in Boston, you remember, from 1723 until
1726, when he went to Philadelphia and did
publishing work until 1756. A hand press
identical in principle with the one he used is
still preferred to this day in the large newspaper
press rooms for striking off proof when the
amount of it is too small to be put through a
power press. The hand press is a simple and
quick agent for getting a result. The ink roller
is run over the type and hand pressure is applied.
One could not of course print a large
newspaper on such a limited scale; but for job<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>bing
work Franklin's variety of press is still
acceptable and unrivaled."</p>

<p>"It seems funny to think of a Boston paper
ever being so small," mused the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright smiled.</p>

<p>"And not only small but of infrequent issue,"
said the paper manufacturer. "In 1709
there was only one daily paper published in
London; twelve appeared three times a week;
and three twice a week."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is amazing, isn't it? <i>The Tatler</i>
began in 1709 and <i>The Spectator</i> not long
afterward. You must recall that the entire
newspaper industry as we know it has been developed
within comparatively recent years.
The great daily, with its Sunday edition of pictures,
colored sheets, news of classified varieties,
and advertising and sporting sections, is
only possible by means of the modern press
which has the capacity for turning out in a
short time such an immense number of papers."</p>

<p>Paul listened, fascinated by the subject.</p>

<p>"Gradually," went on Mr. Wright, "new
brains attacked the problems of the small press,
improving and enlarging it until little by little
a press was built up which is so intricate and
so wonderful that it almost ceases to be a machine
and becomes nearly human. Boston, you
know, harbors the largest printing press in the
world. It is made up of 383,000 parts; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
carries eight huge rolls of paper weighing from
thirteen hundred to fifteen hundred pounds,
four of them at each end; and in addition it has
two color presses attached on which the colored
supplement is printed."</p>

<p>"How do they ever lift such heavy rolls of
paper into place?" inquired Paul.</p>

<p>"A chain is put around them and they are
hoisted up by machinery," answered Mr.
Wright. "The employees are warned to stand
from under, too, when they are lifted, for
should one of those mighty rolls fall, the person
beneath might be seriously injured or perhaps
killed."</p>

<p>"How many papers can they turn out on a
press of that size?" was Paul's next question.</p>

<p>"It is possible to turn out 726,000 eight-page
papers an hour or the equivalent of that quantity;
the number of papers depends on the size
of them, you see."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose good Benjamin
Franklin would say to that?" laughed Paul.</p>

<p>"I fancy he would remark a number of
things," Mr. Wright returned. "In fact, a
modern newspaper plant, with its myriad devices
for meeting the business conditions of our
time, would be quite an education to Franklin,
as it is to the rest of us. Did you ever see a
big newspaper printed from start to finish,
Paul?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, that's a pity. As a publisher you
should be better informed on your subject,"
observed the elder man half teasingly. "I am
going to Boston on Saturday. If your father
is willing would you like to go along with me
and spend the week-end in town?"</p>

<p>The lad's eyes shone.</p>

<p>"Would I like it!" he managed to stammer.</p>

<p>"I've got to see some of the business houses
we supply with paper," continued Mr. Wright,
"and incidentally I am sure I could arrange a
visit to a big newspaper office Saturday evening
when they are getting out the Sunday papers
and have all their presses in operation."</p>

<p>"That would be great!"</p>

<p>"I think you would enjoy the trip," asserted
Mr. Wright. "The printing of a paper is a
wonderful process to see. I have a great admiration
and respect for a fine newspaper, anyway.
When one considers how widely it is
read and the influence it possesses for good or
evil, one cannot but take off his hat to it. No
agency in the community can more quickly stir
up or allay strife. Public opinion to no small
extent takes its cue from the papers. They are
great educators, great molders of the minds of
the rank and file. Let the papers whisper war
or national calamity and the stock markets all
over the world are affected. And that is but
one of the vital influences the paper wields.
The temper of the whole people is colored by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
what they read. Whenever the editorials of
reputable papers work toward a specific goal,
they usually achieve it. Have we not had a
striking example of that during the present
war? The insidious power of propaganda is
incalculable. Fortunately our national papers
are high-minded and patriotic and have directed
their influence on the side of the good, quieting
fear, promoting loyalty, encouraging honesty,
and strengthening the nobler impulses that
govern the popular mind. For people are to
an extent like a flock of sheep; they give way
to panic very quickly. What one thinks the
next one is liable to believe. Much of this
opinion is in the hands of the newspapers. At
the same time, the minds of the greater thinkers
of the country are often clarified by reading the
opinions mirrored by the press. One cannot
praise too highly the wisdom and discretion of
our newspapers during the perilous days of
war when a word from them might have been
as a match to tinder, and when they held many
important secrets in their keeping. The great
dailies were loyal to the last degree and the confidence
that was placed in them was never betrayed.
It was unavoidable that they should
possess knowledge that the rest of us did not;
but they never divulged it when cautioned that
to do so would be against the national welfare.
The sailings of ships, the departure of troops,
the names of the ports from which vessels left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the shipment of food and supplies&mdash;all tidings
such as these the press withheld."</p>

<p>"It was bully of them!" Paul exclaimed with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes, they rendered a great service. And
you must remember that it was especially difficult
since there is always a keen rivalry between
papers and a tremendous eagerness to
be the first one with the news. Whenever a
paper gets inside information of an interesting
nature there is a great temptation to publish it.
There have been few such offenses, however,
during the present war, be it said to the newspaper
men's credit. Hence it became possible
for the President to grant regular interviews
to the leading reporters of the country and
speak to them with comparative frankness with
regard to national policies without fear that
what he said would be garbled and turned to
mischievous ends."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I ever thought before of the
responsibility the papers had," remarked Paul
soberly.</p>

<p>"Their responsibility is immeasurable," replied
Mr. Wright. "The opportunity a paper
has for checking rash judgment and arousing
the best that is in humanity is endless. That is
why I should like to control a newspaper, that
I might make it the mouthpiece of all that is
highest and noblest. To my mind only persons
of splendid ideals should be entrusted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
publishing of papers. If the editor is to form
the opinion of the masses, he should be a man
worthy of his mission."</p>

<p>Paul toyed with his cuff-link.</p>

<p>"So, son," concluded Mr. Wright, "you've
got to be a very good person if you aim to be a
newspaper man&mdash;at least, that's what I think.
Any printed word is like seed; it is liable to take
root you know not where. A paper voices the
thought of those who produce it. Therefore it
behooves its makers to consider well their
thoughts."</p>

<p>The boy winced and a flush surged to his
forehead. Certainly Mr. Wright would not
approve of the fifty-dollar bill which at that
instant lay concealed in his pocket. As he
turned to leave the room, he was very conscious
of the leather pocketbook that pressed against
his heart. He wished he was clear of that
money. But he had already kept it more than
two weeks and it was of course too late to return
it now.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">PAUL MAKES A PILGRIMAGE TO THE CITY</h3>


<p>The trip to Boston which Mr. Wright suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
materialized into quite as delightful an
excursion as Paul had anticipated. In fact,
it was an eventful journey, filled with every
variety of wonderful experience.</p>

<p>The elder man and his young guest arrived
in the city Friday night in plenty of time to enjoy
what Paul called <i>a great feed</i> and afterward
go to a moving-picture show. It was odd to
the suburban boy to awake Saturday morning
amid the rumble and roar from pavements and
crowded streets. But there was no leisure to
gaze from the window down upon the hurrying
throng beneath, for Mr. Wright was off early
to keep a business engagement and during his
absence Paul was to go to the circus. Accordingly
the lad hurried his dressing and was
ready to join his host for breakfast promptly at
eight.</p>

<p>A league baseball game followed after
lunch and with a morning and an afternoon so
crammed with pleasure Paul would have felt
amply repaid for the trip had no evening's en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>tertainment
followed. The evening, however,
turned out to be the best part of the day; at
least, when Paul tumbled into bed that night,
wearied out by his many good times, he asserted
that the crowning event of his holiday had
given him more interesting things to think
about.</p>

<p>It was not until nine o'clock Saturday evening
that they could go to the newspaper office.</p>

<p>"Before that hour," explained Mr. Wright,
"there will be very little for us to see. The
compositors, of course, will previously have
been busy setting type; but you can get an idea
how that is done in a very short time. What I
want you to see are the giant presses when they
are running to their full capacity. To get out
the Sunday edition of the paper the entire plant
is in operation."</p>

<p>Therefore the two travelers loitered long at
dinner and at nine o'clock presented themselves
at the magic spot where they were to meet one
of Mr. Wright's friends who was to show them
through the various departments of the press
plant.</p>

<p>When they reached this Eldorado, however,
Paul was disappointed.</p>

<p>The manager's office seemed very quiet. A
dim light burned and a few men moved in and
out of the adjacent rooms. Now and then a
telephone jangled, or a reporter, perched on the
arm of a chair or on the corner of a desk, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
out a yellow sheet of paper and ran his eye over
its contents. But there was none of the bustle
and rush that the lad had pictured. But before
Paul had had time to become really downhearted,
the door of an inner office opened and a
man came forward to meet them.</p>

<p>"Ah, Wright, I'm glad to see you!" he
called, extending his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you too, Hawley. I expect
we're making you a deal of trouble and
that you wish us at the bottom of the Dead
Sea."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!"</p>

<p>"That's mighty nice of you," laughed Mr.
Wright. "I give you my word, I appreciate it.
This is my young friend Paul Cameron, the
editor-in-chief of the Burmingham <i>March
Hare</i>."</p>

<p>If Mr. Hawley were ignorant of the <i>March
Hare's</i> existence or speculated at all as to what
that unique publication might be, he at least
gave no sign; instead he took Paul's hand, remarking
gravely:</p>

<p>"I am glad to know you, Cameron," upon the
receipt of which courtesy Cameron rose fully
two inches in his boots and declared with equal
fervor:</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet you too, Mr. Hawley."</p>

<p>To have seen them one would have thought
they had been boon companions at press club
dinners or associates in newspaper work all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
their days. "I'm going to take you upstairs
first," Mr. Hawley said briskly. "We may
as well begin at the beginning and show you
how type is set. I don't know whether you
have ever seen any type-making and typesetting
machines or not."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen anything," Paul confessed
frankly.</p>

<p>The newspaper man looked both amused and
pleased.</p>

<p>"I'm rather glad of that," he remarked,
"for it is much more interesting to explain a
process to a person to whom it is entirely new.
Formerly the method of setting type for the
press was a tedious undertaking and one very
hard on the eyes; but now this work is all done,
or is largely done, by linotype machines that
place in correct order the desired letters,
grouping them into words and carefully
spacing and punctuating them. The linotype
operator has before him a keyboard and as he
presses the keys in succession, the letter or
character necessary drops into its proper place
in the line that is being made up. These letters
are then cast as they stand in a solid, one-line
piece. With the lines thus made up, the compositors
are relieved of a great proportion of
their labor. Later I will show you how this is
done.</p>

<p>"In the composing room there is also the monotype,
another ingenious invention, which pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>duces
single letters and prepares them for casting.
With two such machines you might suppose
that the compositor would have little to do.
Nevertheless, in spite of each of these labor-saving
devices, there are always odd jobs to be
done that cannot be performed by either of these
agencies; there are short articles, the making
up and designing of pages, advertisements, and
a score of things outside the scope of either
linotype or monotype."</p>

<p>Paul listened attentively.</p>

<p>"After the words have been formed and the
lines cast by the linotype, the separate lines are
arranged by the compositors inside a frame the
exact size of the page of the paper to be printed.
This frame or form as we call it, is divided
into columns and after all the lines of type, the
cuts, and advertisements to be used are arranged
inside it, so that there is no waste space,
a cast is made of the entire form and its contents.
This cast is then fitted upon the rollers
of the press, inked, and successive impressions
made from it. This, in simple language, is
what we are going to see and constitutes the
printing of a paper."</p>

<p>Paul nodded.</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Mr. Hawley, "we
shall see much more than that. We shall, for
example, see how cuts and advertisements are
made; photographs copied and the plates prepared
for transfer to the paper; color sheets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in process of making; in fact, all the varied departments
of staff work. But what I have told
you are the underlying principles of the project.
I want you to understand them at the outset so
that you will not become confused."</p>

<p>"I think I have it pretty straight," smiled
Paul.</p>

<p>"Very well, then; we'll get to work."</p>

<p>"Not that I thoroughly understand how all
this is done," added the boy quickly. "But I
have the main idea and when I see the thing in
operation I shall comprehend it more clearly, I
am sure. You see, I don't really know much
of anything about printing a paper. All I am
actually sure of is that often the making up of
a page is a big puzzle. I've had enough experience
to find that out."</p>

<p>"That is sometimes a puzzle for us, too,"
smiled Mr. Hawley. "Fitting stuff into the
available space is not always easy. Usually,
however, we know just how many words can
be allowed a given article and can make up our
forms by estimating the mathematical measurement
such copy will require. When the type is
set in the forms, so accurately cut are the edges,
and so closely do the lines fit together, the whole
thing can be picked up and held upside down
and not a piece of its mosaic fall out. That is
no small stunt to accomplish. It means that
every edge and corner of the metal type is absolutely
true and exact. If it were not, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
form would not lock up, or fit together. The
letters, too, are all on the same level and the
lines parallel. Geometrically, it is a perfect
surface."</p>

<p>"Some picture puzzle!" Mr. Wright observed
merrily.</p>

<p>"One better than a jigsaw puzzle," said Mr.
Hawley. "Our pieces are smaller."</p>

<p>The three visitors stepped from the elevator
and paused at the door of a crowded room,
where many men were at work.</p>

<p>"These are the composing rooms," explained
Mr. Hawley. "Here the copy sent us by reporters
and editors is set up for the press.
Along the walls you will see tiers of drawers in
which type of various kinds and sizes is kept.
The style or design of letter is called the 'face',
and there are a great many sorts of faces, as
you will notice by the labels on the drawers.
There is Cheltenham, Ionic, Gothic&mdash;a multitude
of others. There are, in addition, almost
as many sizes of letters as there are faces, the
letters running from large to a very small, or
agate size which is used for footnotes."</p>

<p>He opened a drawer and Paul glanced inside
it.</p>

<p>"But the letters do not seem to be arranged
with any system at all," exclaimed the boy in
surprise. "I don't see how the men can ever
find what they want. I should think&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off, embarrassed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"You should think what?" asked Mr. Hawley
good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"Why, it just seems to me that if the letters
were arranged in alphabetical order it would be
a great deal easier to get them when one was
in a hurry."</p>

<p>"It would seem so on the face of it," agreed
Mr. Hawley, pleased by the lad's intelligence.
"Printers, however, never arrange type that
way. Instead, they put in the spot nearest at
hand the letters they will use oftenest. It saves
time. The men soon become accustomed to the
position of these and can put their hands on
them quickly and without the least trouble.
The largest compartments in the drawers are
given over to the letters most commonly in use,
such as vowels and frequently recurring consonants.
The letter Z you will notice has only
a small space allowed it; X, too, is not much in
demand."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"Take one of these letters out and examine
it."</p>

<p>Paul did so.</p>

<p>It was a thin bar of what appeared to be lead
and was an inch long. On the end of it a single
letter was cast.</p>

<p>"Besides these cases of letters, we have
drawers of marks and signs arranged according
to the same system, those most often in use
being at the front of the drawer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must have taken forever to hunt up the
right letters and spell out the words before
linotypes were invented," mused Paul.</p>

<p>"Yes, any amount of time was wasted that
way," said Mr. Hawley. "The strain on the
eyes was, too, something appalling. It is quite
another matter to sit at a keyboard and with the
pressure of a key assemble the proper matrices,
as the type molds are called, and arrange in
desired order correctly spaced and punctuated
lines of type. Come over here and see how the
work is done."</p>

<p>Crossing the floor, they stood before a machine
where an operator was busy fingering a
keyboard as if it were a typewriter. As he
touched each key, it released a letter, and at
the back of the machine Paul could see the
silvery gleam as the miniature bar of metal
dropped down and slipped into its place in the
lengthening series of words. As soon as the
row increased to line length, it moved along and
a new line of words was assembled. The process
was fascinating and the boy watched it
spellbound.</p>

<p>"That's corking!" he at last burst out.</p>

<p>"It is a marvelous invention, certainly," responded
Mr. Hawley, delighted by the enthusiasm
of the <i>March Hare's</i> editor.</p>

<p>"What metal is used for casting type?" inquired
Paul suddenly. "It looks like lead."</p>

<p>"It is not pure lead," Mr. Hawley answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
"That metal has been found to be much too
soft; it soon wears down and loses its outline
and its sharp edges. So an alloy of antimony
is mixed with the lead and a composition is
made that is harder and more durable."</p>

<p>"It must be quite a stunt to get the mixture
just right," remarked Paul.</p>

<p>Again the newspaper man smiled with pleasure.
It was a satisfaction to have so intelligent
an audience.</p>

<p>"You have put your finger on a very important
feature of the newspaper business," he
rejoined. "The man who prepares the metal
solution and keeps it at just the proper degree
of temperature for casting is the person to
whom the printer owes no small measure of his
success. When we go downstairs, we shall see
how the forms that are set here are cast in two
large metal sections that fit on the two halves of
the cylindrical rollers of the press. A mold of
the form is first made from a peculiar kind of
cardboard, a sort of <a name="papier" id="papier"></a><i>papier-mâché</i>, and by forcing
hot metal into this mold a cast, or stereotype,
of the page is taken. It is from this metal
stereotype that the paper is printed. After the
two sections are fastened securely upon the
cylinders and inked by machinery, the great
webs of paper at either end of the press unroll,
and as they move over the rapidly turning
wheels, your daily newspaper is printed for
you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are we going to see it done?" asked Paul
eagerly.</p>

<p>"We certainly are," said Mr. Hawley, leading
the way toward the elevator.</p>

<p>"Of course the compositors have to be very
sure before the forms go to the stereotype casting
room that there are no mistakes in them, I
suppose," Paul ventured thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes. There is no correcting the stereotype
after it is once made," replied Mr. Hawley.
"Everything is corrected and any exchange of
letters made before it is cast. Men who handle
type constantly become very expert in detecting
errors, many compositors being able to read
type upside down, or in reversed order, as easily
as you can read a straightforward line of
printed matter."</p>

<p>Mr. Hawley paused.</p>

<p>"In addition to this department," he presently
continued, "is the room where the plates
for the color section of the paper are prepared.
After the drawing for the pictures is made, it
is outlined on a block of metal and afterward
cut out, so that the design remains in relief;
then the impression is taken with colored inks,
a separate printing being made for each color in
turn, except where the colors are permitted to
fuse before they dry in order to produce a secondary
tone. You doubtless have seen the lithograph
process and know how the first printing
colors all the parts of the picture that are red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
for example; the next impression prints the blue
parts; and the third those that are green."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've seen posters printed."</p>

<p>"Then you know how the work is done."</p>

<p>"And it is for printing this colored supplement
that the color-decks at each end of the
big press are used?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. We often run these colored sections
of the Sunday edition off some weeks in
advance, as they are independent parts of the
paper and need not necessarily be turned out
at the last moment as the news sections must."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"We also have our designing rooms for the
drawing of fashion pictures, and the illustrations
to accompany advertisements. All that
is a department in itself, and a most interesting
branch of the work. These cuts are prepared
on sheets of metal and are cast and
printed as the rest of the paper is; they are set
into the forms and stereotyped by the same
method as the printed matter. When we want
reproductions from photographs we have a
photo-engraving department where by means of
a very powerful electric light we can reproduce
pictures of all sorts; pen-drawings, facsimiles
of old prints, photographs, and every variety of
picture imaginable. These are developed on
a sheet of metal instead of on a glass plate and
then reproduced."</p>

<p>"That is the way you get the fine picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
sheets that you enjoy so much, Paul," put in
Mr. Wright.</p>

<p>"The photo-engraving took the place of the
woodcut," Mr. Hawley explained. "The process
has been constantly improved until now we
are able to get wonderfully artistic results."</p>

<p>"I had no idea there were so many different
departments required to get out a paper," remarked
Paul slowly. "It is an awful piece of
work, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Their guide laughed.</p>

<p>"It is quite a project," he answered. "Of
course, much of it becomes routine, and we
think nothing about it. But I am sure that
few persons who read the papers realize the
great amount of time and thought that goes
into turning out a good, up-to-date, artistically
illustrated newspaper. The mere mechanical
toil required is enormous; and in addition to
this labor there is all the bustle, rush, and rivalry
attending the securing of the latest news.
The editorial office has its set of problems, as
you know, if you yourself get out a paper."</p>

<p>"I've been so absorbed in the machinery that
I forgot the editorial end of it for a moment,"
Paul said.</p>

<p>"Don't forget it, for it is the backbone of
the business," replied Mr. Hawley. "All that
part of our work is conducted as systematically
as the rest. Each editorial writer and reporter
is detailed to his particular work and must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
his copy in promptly; he must know his facts
and write them up with accuracy, charm, and
spirit, the articles must also have the punch that
will carry them and make people interested in
reading them. A writer who can't turn out
this sort of stuff has no place in the newspaper
world. Every article that comes in is either
used, returned, or filed away and catalogued
for future reference; we call the room where the
envelopes containing such matter are stacked
the graveyard. Every newspaper has its
graveyard. Into it goes stuff that has perhaps
been paid for and never printed; clippings that
can be used for reference; every sort of material.
We can put our hand on any article filed,
at a moment's notice. Come in and see for
yourself the great tiers of shelves with the contents
of each shelf classified and marked."</p>

<p>Paul followed him.</p>

<p>There indeed was the room, its shelves reaching
to its ceiling and as neatly and completely
arranged as they would be in a library. Sections
were given over to business interests; to
well-known men and women; to accidents; to
shipping; to material of every description.</p>

<p>The visitors could not, however, delay to
investigate this department, fascinating as it
was. They were hurried on to another floor
and were shown where all the accounts of advertisers
were computed by means of an automatic
device that registered the space taken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a specific firm and the price of such space.
There was also a circulation department where
lists of subscribers and records of their subscriptions
were filed and billed.</p>

<p>Such ingenious contrivances were new to the
village boy and his eyes widened. "I think
we ought to pay more for our papers," he
gasped. "I had no idea that publishing a newspaper
meant so much work. I don't think we
pay half enough money for all this trouble."</p>

<p>Mr. Hawley smiled.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I don't think we do either," he
said.</p>

<p>"This is such a tremendous plant!" the boy
went on breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Our paper is more of an undertaking, then,
than your <i>March Hare</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, rather!" chuckled Paul. "I thought
we had quite a proposition until I saw all this.
Now the mere writing of copy seems like nothing
at all. What a job it is to print the stuff
after you get it!"</p>

<p>"They say there is no better way to become
cheered up than to take a peep at some other
fellow's tribulations," Mr. Hawley declared.
"Now suppose you go down to the press room
and see some of ours at first hand."</p>

<p>He led the way to an elevator that dropped
them quickly to the basement of the building.</p>

<p>"Do they always put the presses downstairs?"
asked Paul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Practically always, yes," replied Mr. Hawley.
"It is necessary to do so because of the
immense weight of the presses. The problems
of the vibration of machinery and the support
of its weight always govern all factory construction
and the building of plants of a similar
nature. Most newspaper presses are therefore
placed on solid ground, or as near it as possible,
in order to minimize the difficulties arising
from these two conditions. Some years ago,
however, the <i>Boston Post</i> ventured an innovation by
arranging its presses one over the other,
three in a tier; and as the experiment has proved
a success, many other large newspapers in various
parts of the country have followed their
example."</p>

<p>"If floor space can be economized it must be
a great saving to newspaper plants whose buildings
are in the heart of a city; real estate is no
small item of expense," observed Mr. Wright.</p>

<p>"Precisely," agreed Mr. Hawley. "Yet
high as were rentals and taxes, no one had had
the courage to try a press constructed on another
plan. It meant, of course, a new set of
difficulties to solve. I happen to know, for instance,
that when the floor for the sub-basement
of the <i>Post</i> was constructed, the beams
were set close enough together to support a
weight of four hundred pounds to each square
foot of space. This was not entirely necessary
but it was done as a precaution against accident.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Sometimes the mammoth rolls of paper fed
into the presses fall when being hoisted into
place and drop with a crash. If the floor were
not strong the whole fifteen hundred pounds
might go through and carry everything with
it. The builders wished to be prepared for an
emergency of this sort."</p>

<p>"They were wise."</p>

<p>"They could take no chances," said Mr.
Hawley gravely. "The cellars, you see, run
five stories below ground. They had to dig
down, down, down to get the room they needed.
The disadvantage of this is that all materials
and all the printed papers as well have to be
hoisted to and from the ground floor, and air
and water must be pumped from the street level.
Nevertheless, that this can be done has been
proved. The questions of heating and ventilation
are the most serious ones, for in the press
rooms the thermometer cannot be permitted to
vary more than a few degrees, either in winter
or summer; any marked difference in temperature
instantly affects the flow of the ink, causing
no end of trouble. For that reason we have
fans and all sorts of mechanical contrivances
to keep the rooms at the desired heat."</p>

<p>"I should think you had conquered almost
every imaginable difficulty," Mr. Wright remarked.</p>

<p>"Pretty nearly," returned Mr. Hawley good-naturedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>They had now reached the lowest floor and
the press rooms were a whir of noise and clatter.
As the three entered, the hum of the machinery
rendered further speech impossible.</p>

<p><a name="q179" id="q179"></a>Paul gazed up at the presses that towered
high above his head.</p>

<p>There was the mighty machine and there
were the hurrying workers, walking about it;
some stood on the cement floor, and others
moved here and there along the small swinging
platforms that circled the upper part of the
leviathan. In mid-air, held by mighty chains,
hung the rolls of blank paper that were soon to
be transformed into newspapers. As the vast
spools of unprinted material were reeled off,
the ribbons of whiteness passed like a spider's
web in and out the turning wheels, and as they
moved over the inked cylinders that printed
them on both sides, the happenings of the
world were recorded with lightning speed. In
the meantime into the racks below were constantly
dropping papers neatly folded,&mdash;papers
that were finished and had each section arranged
in its proper place; and to Paul's amazement
an automatic machine counted these as
they came from the press.</p>

<p>Whenever a certain number of papers were
counted out a man came forward, hoisted the
lot to his shoulder and disappeared into the
elevator with it; or handed it to some one whose
it duty it was to load it on to a truck, carry it up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>stairs,
and put it into one of the myriad
wagons that waited at the curb for its load.
As fast as these wagons were filled they dashed
off, bearing the Sunday editions to railway stations
for shipping, or to distributing centers
throughout the city; others had wrappers put
on them and were dispatched to the mailing department
to be addressed and forwarded to
patrons who lived out of town.</p>

<p>"Some business, eh, Paul?" said Mr.
Wright.</p>

<p>"You bet it is!"</p>

<p>"About one third of all the wood-pulp paper
produced in America goes into newspapers and
periodicals," Mr. Hawley managed to shout
above the uproar of the whirling wheels.
"That is where so many of our spruce, poplar,
and hemlock trees go. Telephone books, telephone
blanks, transfers for electric cars, city
directories, play bills, consume a lot of paper;
then in addition to the papers printed in English
there are in America papers printed in
fifty different foreign languages."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder there was a shortage of paper
during the war," stammered Paul.</p>

<p>"It hit us pretty close," Mr. Hawley owned.
"Our Sunday editions had to be curtailed a
good deal, and many of the monthly publications
were put out of business entirely by the
high cost of paper. The monthly magazine
is, you know, a great seller in rural communi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>ties.
A newspaper is usually a local affair; but
the monthly circulates all over the country and
is not by any means confined to the district in
which it is published."</p>

<p>"It makes a nice lot of work for the Post
Office Department," put in Mr. Wright jestingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does," agreed Mr. Hawley.</p>

<p>"I suppose book publishing and music publishing
take more paper," mused Paul.</p>

<p>"Yes. The printing of music is an expensive
and fussy piece of work, too. It must be
accurately done, and done by men who are experienced
in that special kind of work. One
misprint will cause a discord and throw the
music out of sale. Of course if a song turns
out to be popular, a small fortune is often
reaped from it; but if it is not, the cost of getting
it out is so great that little is netted by the
publishers."</p>

<p>They moved on into another room where it
was more quiet, leaving the hum of the presses
behind them.</p>

<p>"This," explained Mr. Hawley, "is the stereotype-casting
room of which I told you. It is
here that the <i>papier-mâché</i> forms made from
the forms you saw in linotype are brought and
cast in solid pieces for the presses. Let us
watch the process. You can see how they fasten
the paper impression around this mold so
that the cast of it can be taken. The hot metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
is run in, and pressed into every depression of
the cardboard. The thickness of these semi-cylindrical
casts is carefully specified and over
there is a machine that pares off or smooths
away all superfluous material so that they come
out exactly the proper thickness; otherwise they
would not fit the rollers of the press."</p>

<p>Paul watched. Sure enough! After being
cast, the sections of stereotype were put
into the machine indicated and moved quickly
along, being planed off as they went; when they
emerged the wrong side of them was smooth
and even.</p>

<p>"This kettle or tank of hot metal," went on
Mr. Hawley, pointing to a vat of seething composition,
"has to be kept, as I explained to you,
at a specified degree of heat if we are to get successful
stereotypes of our forms. Therefore a
great deal depends on the skill and judgment of
the man who prepares and melts down the mixture
bubbling in that kettle. Without his brain
and experience there could be no newspapers."</p>

<p>As he spoke Mr. Hawley waved a salutation
to the workman in blue overalls who was studying
the indicator beside the furnace.</p>

<p>"That indicator tells the exact temperature
of the melted solution in the kettle; also the
temperature of the furnace. There can be no
variation in heat without hindering the work of
casting, and perhaps wrecking the casts and
wasting a quantity of material. So on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
little chap over there by the fire hangs our
fate."</p>

<p>The workman heard the words and smiled,
and Paul smiled in return.</p>

<p>"Do they make stereotypes for circular rollers
and print books this same way?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. Most books are electrotyped, the machinery
being much less complex than is the
newspaper press. A rotary press cannot do
such fine or accurate work."</p>

<p>For a moment they lingered, watching the
busy scene with its shifting figures. Then they
stepped into the elevator and were shot up to
the street level. The hands of the clock stood
at eleven when at last they emerged upon the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>Paul sighed.</p>

<p>"Tired?"</p>

<p>"Rather, sir; aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I just feel as if I had played sixteen
holes of golf," Mr. Wright replied. They
laughed together.</p>

<p>"But, Jove! It was worth it though, wasn't
it?" cried Paul.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"I, too! Only," added the boy, "I still believe
we ought to pay more for our newspapers."</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE DECISION</h3>


<p>For the next few days after his return from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Boston Paul thought and talked of little else
save the great newspaper press that he had
seen. Beside a project as tremendous as the
publication of a widely circulated daily the
<i>March Hare</i> became a pitifully insignificant
affair.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the <i>March Hare</i> was not to be
thrust aside. It clamored for attention. Its
copy came in as before from students and staff,
and mixed with this material were some exceptionally
fine articles from patents and distant
alumnæ. Judge Damon had taken to contributing
a short, crisp editorial almost every
month, something of civic or national importance;
and two of Burmingham's graduates
who were in France sent letters that added an
international flavor to the magazine. Never
had the issues been so good. Certainly the
monthly so modestly begun had ripened into an
asset that all the town would regret to part
with.</p>

<p>In the meantime graduation was approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and the day was drawing near when 1920 must
bid good-by to the familiar halls of the school,
and instead of standing and looking down from
the top of the ladder, as it now did, it must set
forth into the turmoil of real life where its
members would once again be beginners.
What an ironic transformation that would be!
A senior was a person looked up to by the entire
student body, a dignitary to be treated with profound
respect. But once outside the sheltering
walls of his Alma Mater he would suddenly
become a very ordinary being who, like Samson
shorn of his locks, would enter business or
college a weak, timid neophyte. It seemed absurd
that such a change could be wrought in so
short a time.</p>

<p>But before the day when the diplomas with
their stiff white bows would be awarded, the
future fate of the <i>March Hare</i> must be decided.
Every recurrence of this thought
clouded Paul's brow. He still had intact Mr.
Carter's fifty-dollar bill. It was as crisp and
fresh as on the day the magnate of Burmingham
had put it into his hand, and the typewriter
Paul coveted still glistened in the window of a
shop on the main street. Day after day he had
vacillated between the school and that fascinating
store window, and each day he had looked,
envied, and come home again. It was now so
late that the purchase of this magic toy would
be of little use to him. Nevertheless, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
wanted it. Every night when he went to bed
he quieted his conscience's accusations of cowardice
by arguing that the money had not been
spent. But not spending it, he was forced to
own, was far from being the same thing as returning it.
It was strange that it should be so
hard for him to part with that money!</p>

<p>In the interim he had cashed in his war
stamps and with the additional sum he had
earned for doing the chores around the place
he and Melville Carter had paid the bill the
<i>March Hare</i> owed and deposited the remainder
of their combined cash in the bank, so that the
accounts now stood even. Whatever should
now become of the magazine, its slate was a
clean one so far as its financial standing went.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of all debts and entanglements,
only the adjustment of the deal
with Mr. Carter remained. This was not so
easily to be cleared from Paul's path.</p>

<p>It was his first thought in the morning, his
last at night. He could never escape from it.
Whenever he was in jubilant mood and in a
flood of boyish happiness had forgotten it, it
arose like a specter to torment him. What was
he going to do with that money that he had kept
so long? And what was he going to say to
his classmates to earn it,&mdash;for earn it he must,
since he had accepted it. It was a wretched
position to be in. Why hadn't he given the bill
back to the great man that day in the office?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Or if he had no opportunity then, why hadn't
he carried it promptly to the <i>Echo</i> building the
next morning? He might have gone to Mr.
Carter's house with it. There were a score of
ways it might have been delivered to its rightful
owner. Alas, he had been very weak, and by
drifting along and taking no positive action
had got himself into the dilemma in which he
now floundered.</p>

<p>It was the president of 1921 who suddenly
brought him up with a sharp turn by remarking
one day:</p>

<p>"Well, Kip, you people of 1920 have certainly
set us a pretty pace on the <i>March Hare</i>.
I don't know whether, when it descends to us,
we shall be able to keep it up to your standard
or not."</p>

<p>"Descends to you!" repeated Paul vaguely.</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course 1920 is going to pass it on.
You fellows can't very well take it with you,"
laughed the junior.</p>

<p>Paul evaded a direct answer.</p>

<p>"You never can tell which way a hare will
run," he replied.</p>

<p>"You can usually figure on the direction he
will take, though," retorted the under-classman,
whose name was Converse. "1920 has done
the school a big service by founding the paper
and outlining its policy. My father was saying
only last night that the magazine was well
worth putting on a permanent business basis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
He said that if an experienced publishing house
had the handling of it it could be made into a
money-making proposition&mdash;that is if everybody,
young and old, would keep up their same
enthusiasm for turning in stuff so the tone of
the thing was not spoiled."</p>

<p>"I believe that, too."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be such a bad idea if next year
we could get in an experienced hand to help us,
would it?"</p>

<p>The moment Paul dreaded had come.</p>

<p>He summoned all his dignity.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he answered, "just what
1920 will decide to do with the paper when we
finish the year. We may sell it."</p>

<p>"What! You don't mean sell it to an outsider?"</p>

<p>"We have an opportunity to do so."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;how could you? It's the
property of the school, isn't it?" stammered
Converse.</p>

<p>"No, not as I see it. A few of us 1920 fellows
started it and have done all the work, or
the bulk of it. If we choose to sell it, I don't
see why we haven't a right to."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Great hat, Kip! You certainly
wouldn't do that!" protested the junior.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;well&mdash;it would be so darn yellow,"
burst out the other boy. "Even if the
thing is yours&mdash;why&mdash;," he broke off help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>lessly.
"And anyway, how could you? Any
number of people are interested in it."</p>

<p>"They could keep on being interested in it."</p>

<p>"You mean somebody else would publish it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"As it is now?"</p>

<p>"Practically. They would give it a more
professional touch, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Do you think for a second that in the hands
of a cut and dried publisher it would be the
same?" asked Converse hotly. "Do you imagine
people would send in articles to it as they
do now?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why not."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't&mdash;not on your life! Why,
the reason that everybody has pitched in and
written for us was precisely because the thing
was not professional, and they knew they would
be free of criticism. The columns have become
a sort of town forum, my father said. Do you
think you could get the same people to speak
out under different conditions? Judge Damon,
for instance, has repeatedly refused to write for
the professional press. He could get a fat
sum for such editorials as he writes for us if
he wanted to sell them. Father said so. Besides,
what's to become of 1921 if you sell out
the <i>March Hare</i>? We couldn't run a rival
paper. If the <i>Hare</i> continued, of course people
would take a thing that was already established
and that they knew about, especially as it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
been so bully. It would end us so far as a
school magazine was concerned."</p>

<p>Paul offered no reply.</p>

<p>"I'd call it a darn mean trick if you put such
a deal over," persisted Converse indignantly,
"and I guess everybody else would. I suppose
you would have the legal right to sell out if
you wanted to; but it has been tacitly understood
from the first that the paper was started
for the good of the school and would be handed
down to your successors."</p>

<p>"I don't see why everybody should jump at
that conclusion."</p>

<p>"Because it is the natural, square thing to
do. Anybody would tell you so."</p>

<p>"I don't need to take a popular vote to settle
my affairs," returned Paul haughtily.</p>

<p>"You may have to in this case," called Converse,
turning on his heel.</p>

<p>The incident left Paul nettled and disturbed,
and in consequence the Latin recitation that
followed went badly; so did his chemistry exam.</p>

<p>The instant recess came he signalled to his
closest literary associates and beckoning them
into an empty classroom, banged the door.</p>

<p>"See here, you chaps," he began, "I've
something to put up to you. We have had an
offer to sell the <i>March Hare</i>. How does the
proposition strike you?"</p>

<p>The boys regarded their leader blankly.</p>

<p>"You mean to&mdash;to&mdash;sell it out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
money?" inquired one of the group stupidly.</p>

<p>Paul laughed.</p>

<p>"What else could we sell it out for, fat-head?"
he returned good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;to sell it out for cash, as it stands&mdash;you
mean that?"</p>

<p>"Righto!"</p>

<p>"Somebody wants to buy it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Gee!"</p>

<p>"We certainly are some little editors,"
chuckled Melville Carter. "Who is the bidder,
Kip?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kip, who wants it?" came breathlessly
from one and another of the group.</p>

<p>It was evident they had no inkling who the
prospective purchaser was.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carter."</p>

<p>"Carter&mdash;of the <i>Echo</i>?"</p>

<p>"My father?" gasped Melville, dumfounded.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has offered to buy us out," continued
Paul steadily. "He'll give us a certain
sum of money to divide between us."</p>

<p>"But could we sell?" asked Melville slowly.</p>

<p>"The thing is ours, isn't it?" replied Paul.
"Haven't we planned it, built it up, and done
all the work?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Melville admitted in a half-convinced
tone.</p>

<p>"I suppose, in point of fact, it really is ours,"
remarked Donald Hall. "But it would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
rotten, low-down trick for us to sell it away
from the school and from 1921, I think."</p>

<p>"Did my father suggest it?" queried Melville.</p>

<p>"Yes. He is quite keen on it. He says it
can be made a paying proposition."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the offer, Kip?"</p>

<p>It was one of the members of the editorial
staff who spoke.</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>Paul turned crimson.</p>

<p>The question was painfully direct.</p>

<p>"Yes," demanded the other boys. "What
do you say, Kipper? What's your opinion?"</p>

<p>Paul looked uneasily into the faces of his
friends. Their eyes were fixed eagerly upon
him. In their gaze he could read confidence
and respect. A flood of scorn for his own
cowardice overwhelmed him. He straightened
himself.</p>

<p>"If you want to know what I honestly think,"
he heard himself saying, "I'd call it a beastly
shame to sell out."</p>

<p>There was a shout of approval. There was
only one boy who did not join in the hubbub; it
was Weldon.</p>

<p>"How much would Carter give us apiece?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you old grafter!" snapped Roger
Bell. "There's no use in your knowing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
You're voted down already. Kip's perfectly
right. We don't want the <i>Echo's</i> money."</p>

<p>"Tell Carter there's nothing doing," put in
a high voice.</p>

<p>"You decide, then, to bequeath the <i>March
Hare</i> to 1921 with our blessing?" asked Paul,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Sure we do!"</p>

<p>"We are poor but honest!" piped Charlie
Decker, rolling his eyes up to the ceiling with
a gesture that brought a roar of applause.
Charlie was the class joke.</p>

<p>A gong sounded.</p>

<p>"There's the bell!" cried somebody. "All
aboard for Greek A!"</p>

<p>Melville Carter reached across and rumpled
up Donald Hall's hair.</p>

<p>"Quit it, kiddo!" protested Donald nervously,
drawing back from his chum's grasp.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, all of a sudden?"
demanded Melville, surprised.</p>

<p>"Nothing! Cut it out, that's all."</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming to Greek?" asked young
Carter.</p>

<p>"In a minute. Trot along; I want to speak
to Kip."</p>

<p>The throng filed out until only Donald and
Paul were in the room.</p>

<p>The editor-in-chief was standing alone at the
window. For the first time in weeks he was
drawing the breath of freedom. A weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
seemed removed from his soul. He had been
weak and vacillating, but when the test had
come he had not been false either to himself or
to his friends. That at least was something.</p>

<p>Thinking that he was alone, he drew from his
pocket the fifty-dollar bill that was to have been
the price of his undoing, and looked at it. He
would take it back that very day to Mr. Carter
and confess that he had not fulfilled the contract
the newspaper owner had tried to force
upon him. A smile parted his lips. It was as
he turned to leave the room that he encountered
Donald Hall.</p>

<p>The expression of the lad's face gave him a
start; there was shame, regret, suffering in it.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Don?" Paul asked.</p>

<p>The boy tried to speak but no words came.</p>

<p>"You're not sick, old chap?"</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"You look so darn queer. Anything I can
do for you?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o. No, I guess not. I just waited to
see if you were coming along."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm coming right now," returned Paul
briskly. "We'll both have to be hopping, or
we'll be late. So long! See you later."</p>

<p>The boys passed out into the corridor together
and there fled in opposite directions.</p>

<p>But Donald's face haunted Paul through the
rest of the morning. What could be the matter
with the boy?</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">AN AMAZING MIRACLE</h3>


<p>At the close of the session that day Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
walked with reluctant feet toward the office of
the <i>Echo</i>.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest difficulty that he had
shaken off the fellows one by one,&mdash;Melville,
Roger Bell, Donald Hall, Billie Ransom, and
the other boys; he had even evaded Converse
who, having heard the good news, came jubilantly
toward him with the words:</p>

<p>"1920 is all right! She never was yellow,
and I knew she wouldn't change color at this
late date."</p>

<p>Paul smiled and passed on. Yes, he had
done the square thing; he knew it perfectly well.
Nor did he regret his action. On the contrary
he was more light-hearted than he had been for
a long time. Nevertheless he did not exactly
fancy the coming interview with Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>He had called up the <i>Echo</i>, and by a bit of
good fortune had managed not only to get into
touch with the editorial office but to reach the
publisher himself. If the business at hand
were important, Mr. Carter would see him. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
was important, Paul said. Then he might
come promptly at four o'clock and the magnate
would give him half an hour.</p>

<p>It was almost four now. The hands of the
clock were moving toward the dreaded moment
only too fast.</p>

<p>Soon, the boy reflected with a little shiver up
his spine, he would be in the bare little sanctum
of the great man, facing those piercing eyes and
handing back the fifty-dollar bill that had lain
in his pocket for so many weeks; and he would
be confessing that he had failed in his mission,&mdash;nay,
worse than that, that he had not even
tried to accomplish it. It would, of course, be
impossible to explain how, when the crisis had
come, something within him had leaped into being,&mdash;something
that had automatically prevented
him from doing what was wrong and
forced him to do what was right. He took
small credit to himself for his deed. It was his
good genius that deserved the praise. He wondered
idly as he went along whether this potent
force had been his conscience or his soul.
Well, it did not matter much; the result was the
same. Conscience, soul, whatever it was, it
was sending him back to Carter with that unspent
bribe money.</p>

<p>He was glad of it. Had he but done this
weeks before, he would have been spared days
and weeks of uncertainty and worry. He realized
now that he had never felt right, felt happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
about that bill. Yet although his bonds were
now to be broken, and he was to be free at last,
the shattering of his fetters was not to be a
pleasant process. He knew Mr. Carter too
well to deceive himself into imagining that the
affair would pass off lightly. Mr. Carter was
a proud man. He would not like having his
gift hurled back into his face. Nor would he
enjoy being beaten. Greater than any value
he would set on the ownership of the <i>March
Hare</i> would loom the consciousness that he had
been defeated, balked by a lot of schoolboys, by
one boy in particular. The incident would
ruffle his vanity and annoy him mightily.</p>

<p>It was with this knowledge that Paul stepped
into the elevator. How he wished there was
some escape from the approaching interview!
If only Mr. Carter should prove to be busy, or
be out!</p>

<p>But Mr. Carter was not busy, and he was not
out! On the contrary, the clerk told Paul that
the great man was expecting him and had given
orders that he was to come into the office as
soon as he arrived.</p>

<p>Gulping down a nervous tremor, the lad
steadied himself and put his hand on the knob
of the awful ground-glass door. Once on the
other side of it and all retreat would be cut off.
Not that he really wished to retreat. It was
only that he dreaded.... The knob turned
and he was inside the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Carter was at his desk dictating a letter;
he finished the last sentence and motioned his
stenographer to withdraw. He then asked Paul
to sit down in the chair the girl had vacated.</p>

<p>"Well, you've got some news for me," he
began without preamble.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Paul replied. "We had a class
meeting to-day. I couldn't put your deal
through, Mr. Carter. I'm bringing back the
money."</p>

<p>He laid the bill on the publisher's desk.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter paid no heed to the money. Instead
he kept his eyes on the boy before him,
studying him through the smoke that clouded
the room.</p>

<p>"You couldn't pull it off, eh?" he said
sharply. "I'm sorry to hear that. What was
the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I didn't try to pull it off."</p>

<p>"Didn't try!"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You mean you didn't advise your staff to
sell out?"</p>

<p>"I spoke against it."</p>

<p>"Against it!" snarled Carter, leaning forward
in his chair.</p>

<p>The room was breathlessly still.</p>

<p>"You see," explained the boy, "the more I
thought about it the less I approved of what you
wanted me to do. I tried to think it was
straight but I didn't really think so. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the fellows asked my honest opinion, I simply
had to tell them the truth."</p>

<p>Mr. Carter made no comment, nor did his
eyes leave Paul's face, but he drew his shaggy
brows together and scowled.</p>

<p>"So," went on Paul desperately, "I've
brought your money back to you. It's the
same bill you gave me. I didn't spend it.
Somehow I couldn't bring myself to."</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. Paul got to
his feet.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;sorry to have disappointed
you, Mr. Carter," he murmured in a low tone as
he moved across the room to go. "You have
been mighty kind to us boys."</p>

<p>The door was open and he was crossing the
threshold before the man at the desk spoke;
then he called:</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, son."</p>

<p>Paul turned.</p>

<p>"Shut that door."</p>

<p>Wondering, the boy obeyed.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter took up the greenback lying before
him.</p>

<p>"So you've been carrying that money round
with you ever since I gave it to you, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"It's a long time; some weeks."</p>

<p>"Yes," stammered Paul. "I ought to have
brought it back to you before."</p>

<p>"I could charge you interest on it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The smile that accompanied the speech escaped
Paul.</p>

<p>"I'll pay whatever you think proper," he
said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, boy! I was only joking," the
publisher hastened to say. "But tell me something;
what was it you wanted that money for?
You must have needed it badly or you would
not have been threatening to sell out your Liberty
Bond."</p>

<p>"I was going to buy a typewriter, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! And you didn't get it. That was a
pity."</p>

<p>The man tapped the edge of the bill he held
against the desk thoughtfully. Paul waited
for him to speak; but when after an interval he
still remained silent the lad shifted uneasily
from one foot to the other and remarked:</p>

<p>"I guess I'll be going along, sir. The half
hour you were to give me is up."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Carter spoke.</p>

<p>"Will you shake hands with me, my boy, before
you go, or have you too poor an opinion of
me for that?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I haven't a poor opinion of you, Mr.
Carter," replied Paul, with hearty sincerity.
"You have always been mighty good to me.
It's true I didn't like your <i>March Hare</i> proposition
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your father hasn't much use for me either,
I'm afraid," Mr. Carter observed moodily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dad thinks you bought up the election."</p>

<p>"He's right. I set out to win a majority in
this town and I did it. But in order to beat a
man as white as your father I had to resort
to a pretty poor weapon. Everything was with
him. Measured up side by side we weren't in
the same class. He was by far the better man
and I knew it. I couldn't beat him as to character
but I could do it with money, and I did.
It was a contemptible game. I've always despised
myself for playing it. I wish you'd tell
your dad so."</p>

<p>Paul could scarcely credit his ears.</p>

<p>"And about this school business," went on
Mr. Carter&mdash;"you were just right, son. The
school should continue the paper along the
lines on which you have started it. It ought
to remain the property of the students, too.
All is, if next year they care to have the <i>Echo</i>
print it, we'll donate the labor free. The
school can pay the actual cost of materials and
I'll see to the rest of it. I can afford to do one
decent thing for Burmingham, I guess."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Carter," gasped Paul, "that would

<p>But the man interrupted him.</p>

<p>"And there's a second-hand typewriter lying
round here somewhere that you can have if
you like. We are getting a new one of another
make. You won't find this much worn I
reckon, and I guess you can manage to get some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
work out of it. I'll send it round to your house
to-morrow in my car."</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The great man put out his hand kindly.</p>

<p>"There, there, run along! I'm busy," he
said. "Don't forget my message to your
father."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Then he added hurriedly:</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you, Mr.
Carter."</p>

<p>"That's all right," nodded the publisher,
cutting him short. "I've always had the
greatest respect for your father. Tell him
from me that he needn't be ashamed of his
son."</p>

<p>With these parting words he waved Paul out
of the office and the door closed.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE CLOUDS CLEAR</h3>


<p>When, glowing with happiness, Paul turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
into his gate late in the afternoon, he was surprised
to find Donald Hall impatiently pacing
the driveway before the house. The boy's
bicycle was against the fence and it was evident
that he had been waiting some time, for a
bunch of lilacs tied to the handle-bar hung limp
and faded in the sun.</p>

<p>"How are you, old man," Paul called jubilantly.
"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Hanging around until you should heave
into sight. I must say you take your time.
Your mother has been expecting you every
minute since school closed."</p>

<p>"I had to go to the <i>Echo</i> office and so got delayed."</p>

<p>"Did you tell Carter about the meeting?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did he take it?"</p>

<p>"He was great&mdash;corking!"</p>

<p>"Really? I thought he'd cut up pretty
rough."</p>

<p>"So did I; but he didn't. He's more decent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
than I gave him credit for being. I like Carter.
He's all right."</p>

<p>"You're the first person I ever heard say so."</p>

<p>"Perhaps people don't know him," replied
Paul warmly. "You can't judge a man hot off
the bat. You've got to try him out."</p>

<p>Donald broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's been tried out all right. People
know him too well; that's the trouble."</p>

<p>Paul stiffened.</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is that I've found Carter
mighty kind. He's treated me white. If you
knew as much about him as I do you'd say so
too. In the meantime I'd thank you to remember
he's my friend and not run him down."</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. Donald dug
the toe of his shoe into the gravel walk and
fidgeted uneasily.</p>

<p>Paul waited a moment, then, attributing his
chum's silence to resentment, he added in a
gentler tone: "I didn't mean to pitch into you
so hard, old chap; it's only that Carter has
been so mighty generous that I couldn't bear
to have you light into him that way."</p>

<p>Donald, however, despite the conciliatory
tone, did not raise his head. Instead he continued
to bore holes in the walk, automatically
hollowing them out and filling them up again
with the tip of his boot.</p>

<p>Paul endured the suspense until at last he
could not endure it any longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say, Don, what's fussing you?" he burst
out.</p>

<p>The visitor crimsoned.</p>

<p>"What makes you think anything is?" he
asked, hedging.</p>

<p>"Well, you wouldn't be loafing around here,
digging up our whole driveway, unless there
was," persisted Paul good-humoredly. "Come,
out with it! You're the darndest kid for getting
into messes. What's happened to you
now?"</p>

<p>There was an affectionate ring in the bantering
words.</p>

<p>Donald smiled feebly. It was true that he
was usually in some scrape or other. It was
not that he did mean or vicious things; Donald
Hall was far too fine a lad for that. But he
never could resist playing a prank, and whenever
he played one he was invariably caught.
Even though every other member of the crowd
got away, Donald never contrived to. The
boys declared this was because he was slow and
clumsy. But the truth really was that he was
wont, in unselfish fashion, to let every one else
go first and was in consequence the unlucky
victim whom the pursuers were sure to capture.
The fleeing culprits were generally in too great
haste to appreciate his altruism and he never
enlightened them. He took his punishment,
loyally refusing to peach on his chums. That
was one reason Donald was such a favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
with his classmates. There was not a fellow in
the school who had more friends. To be sure
they called him "slow coach", "old tortoise",
"fatty", and bestowed upon him many another
gibing epithet, frankly telling him to his face
that he was a big idiot. Nevertheless they did
not conceal from him that he was the sort of
idiot they all loved.</p>

<p>Hence it followed that when Paul saw his
chum in the present disturbed frame of mind
he was much distressed and immediately leaped
to the conclusion that for the hundredth&mdash;nay,
the five hundredth&mdash;time Don had been caught
in the snares of justice.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Tortoise," he repeated; "tell
a chap what's up with you."</p>

<p>"Kip," burst out Donald with sudden vehemence,
"I've done a mighty mean thing."</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Bosh! You never did a mean thing in
your life, kid."</p>

<p>"But I have now," smiled the lad wanly.
"They say there always has to be a first time.
I didn't start out to do it, though. Still, that
doesn't help matters much, for it's ended that
way."</p>

<p>"Going to let me in on it?" asked Paul,
hoping to make the confession easier.</p>

<p>"Yes, I came over on purpose to tell you, Kip.
It's the queerest mix-up you ever heard of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
It's worried me no end. Sometimes, it's
seemed as if I was going nutty."</p>

<p>"Fire ahead! Tell a man, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see a while ago my father sent
me to deposit some money in the bank for him&mdash;a
hundred-dollar bill. I put the envelope in
my pocket, carefully as could be. I remember
perfectly doing it. I didn't go anywhere but
straight down town, either. Well, anyhow,
when I got to the bank the money was gone!
It wasn't in my pocket; it wasn't anywhere
about me."</p>

<p>He stopped an instant.</p>

<p>"You can imagine how I felt. My father
had cautioned me not to lose that money on my
life. I hadn't the nerve to tell him. Somehow
I thought that if I could just smooth the
matter over for a little while the envelope with
the money in it would turn up. I was certain
I couldn't have lost it."</p>

<p>Again he paused.</p>

<p>"At first I thought I'll sell a Liberty bond I
had and put my hundred in the bank to dad's
credit. Then I happened to think that my
father had the bond locked up in his safe-deposit
box and that I couldn't get at it without
telling him. I didn't know what to do. I
simply hadn't the courage to go home and tell
the truth. You wouldn't like to face your
father and tell him you'd lost a cool hundred of
his cash for him. Besides, I was sure it wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
lost. I felt morally certain I had somehow
misplaced that envelope and that it would come
to light. I hunted all day, though, through my
pockets and everywhere I could think of and it
didn't appear. I began to get scared. What
was I going to do? When the bank statement
came in my father would see right off that the
money had not been deposited. And anyway,
even if he didn't, it was only square to tell him
what I'd done. I was casting round for a way
out when that noon Mel called me and asked
me if I'd do an errand for him on the way
home. He wanted me to stop at the bank as I
passed and put in some <i>March Hare</i> money.
It was a hundred dollars and it seemed to drop
right out of the sky into my hands. I decided
to deposit it to my father's credit and trust to
finding the sum I'd lost to square up the school
accounts."</p>

<p>A light of understanding began to break in
on Paul.</p>

<p>He waited.</p>

<p>"I guess you know what's coming," Donald
murmured.</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, somebody does," declared the boy
wretchedly. "That's what's got me fussed.
I chance to know how the <i>March Hare</i> books
stood. Somebody's made good that money I
took&mdash;made it good without saying a word
about it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Donald, studying his friend's face, saw a
gleam of satisfaction pass over it.</p>

<p>"Kip!" he whispered, "was it you? Did
you put the money back when you found it gone
from the treasury?"</p>

<p>"Mel and I divided it. We found the accounts
short and of course we had to do something.
We thought we'd made a mistake in
the books," explained Paul. "So we turned in
the sum and evened things up."</p>

<p>"Without telling anybody?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what was the use of blabbing it all
over town?"</p>

<p>"Gee!"</p>

<p>Donald fumbled in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, I've found the hundred, Kip. Here
it is safe and sound. The envelope had slipped
down through a hole in the lining of my pocket.
The other day when I was hunting for my fountain
pen, I discovered the rip. You bet I was
glad. I'd have made that money good somehow.
I wasn't going to take it. I hope you'll
believe I'm not such a cad as that. But what I
ought to have done was to tell my father in the
first place. It's been an awful lesson to me.
I've worried myself thin&mdash;I have, Kip. You
needn't laugh."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Paul did laugh. He couldn't
help it when he looked at Donald's conscience-smitten
expression. Moreover he could now
afford to laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>But Donald was not so easily consoled.</p>

<p>"I'm almighty sorry, Kip," he said. "The
whole thing has been rotten. Think of you and
Mel Carter turning in your cash to make the
bank accounts square. Where on earth did
you each get your fifty?"</p>

<p>"Some of it was money I'd earned and put
aside toward a typewriter; and the rest I got
by cashing in my war stamps."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!"</p>

<p>Regret and mortification overwhelmed the
culprit.</p>

<p>"It's no matter now, Don."</p>

<p>"But it is, old chap. I suppose that knocked
you out of buying your typewriter. It's a
darn shame."</p>

<p>"I was pretty sore, Don&mdash;no mistake!" admitted
Paul. "But it's all right now. The
accounts are O.K.; I shall get my money back;
and I have a typewriter into the bargain. Mr.
Carter has just given me a second-hand machine
they weren't using."</p>

<p>"Did he know about this muddle?"</p>

<p>"Not a yip! He did know, though, that I
wanted the typewriter."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take back all I ever said about
him," cried Donald. "He's a trump! As for
you, Kip&mdash;you deserve a hundred typewriters!
It's all-fired good of you not to rub this in. I
know I've caused you a lot of trouble and I'm
sorry. That's all I can say."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shut up, Tortoise. It's all right now," repeated
Paul. "Only don't go appropriating
any more funds that don't belong to you. We
might jail you next time. Taking other
people's cash isn't much of a stunt."</p>

<p>"You bet it isn't!" cried Donald heartily.
"When you do it you think it's going to be easy
as fiddle to slip it back again; but it doesn't
seem to turn out that way. Jove, but I'm glad
I'm clear of this mess!"</p>

<p>"I guess we both will sleep better to-night
than we have for one while," called Paul, moving
toward the house. "So long, Don!"</p>

<p>"So long, Kipper. And don't you go losing
that money. It's caused too much worry already."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of it&mdash;don't you fuss about
that. There are no rips in my coat lining."</p>

<p>Thus they parted&mdash;the happiest pair of boys
in all Burmingham.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">GRADUATION</h3>


<p>Thus did Paul's troubles dissolve in air and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with the June winds blow far away. In the
meantime graduation came and the essay he
delivered was clicked off on Mr. Carter's typewriter
which, considering the fact that it was
a second-hand one, was an amazingly fresh and
unscarred machine.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. After the graduation exercises
had come to a close, and the audience
was passing out of the building, Mr. Cameron
and the publisher of the <i>Echo</i> came face to
face in the corridor. They had not met since
the famous mayoral campaign when Carter, by
means of wholesale bribery, had swept all before
him. Hence the present encounter was
an awkward one and many a citizen of Burmingham
stopped to witness the drama. Had
the two men been able to avoid the clash they
would undoubtedly have done so; but the hallway
was narrow and escape was impossible.
Here they were wedged in the crowd, each of
them having come hither to see his son take his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
diploma. It was a day of rejoicing and no time
for grudges.</p>

<p>Melville was at his father's elbow while at
Mr. Cameron's heels tagged Paul, hot, tired,
but victorious.</p>

<p>The instant the group collided the magnate's
hand shot out and gripped that of the editor-in-chief
of the <i>March Hare</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, youngster, I'm proud of you!" he
exclaimed. "You did well. We shall be making
a newspaper man of you yet."</p>

<p>Then, glancing up into the face of the lad's
father, he added with hesitating graciousness:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;congratulate you on your son,
Cameron."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron was not to be outdone.</p>

<p>"And I on yours, Mr. Carter. Melville is a
fine boy. You must be glad that he has done
so well."</p>

<p>"Oh, Melville's not perfect," declared Mr.
Carter, obviously pleased, "but he is all the boy
we've got and we like him."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Our young representatives have done pretty
well on this paper of theirs, haven't they?" remarked
Mr. Carter the next moment.</p>

<p>"They certainly have," agreed Mr. Cameron.
"The <i>March Hare</i> is a very readable and creditable
little magazine. You've done both the
school and the community a service, Carter, by
printing it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've made some blunders in my life, Cameron,
for which I have since been very sorry,"
the rich man said, looking significantly into Mr.
Cameron's eyes. "But printing the <i>March
Hare</i> was not one of them, thank God! We
consider the school paper well worth printing,"
he added in a lighter tone. "Everything the
<i>Echo</i> prints is worth while, you know."</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron laughed at the jest.</p>

<p>"I've been dragged into reading your august
publication, you know," said he. "I subscribed
to it against my will, I must own; however, I
must confess that I have enjoyed it very much.
If you'd change your party, Carter, and come
into the proper political fold&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Carter held up his hand.</p>

<p>"No propaganda, Cameron!" he declared
good-naturedly. "We must learn wisdom of
our children. Their paper is quite non-partisan.
In fact," he continued, lapsing into seriousness,
"the younger generation teaches us
many things. I've learned a lesson or two
from your son. You have put a great deal of
your fineness of principle into him, Cameron.
I hope you realize what a deep respect I entertain
for you. I have always regretted the occurrences
that parted us. If I had my life to
live over again, my dear sir, there are some offenses
that I should not repeat. An honor that
one wins by foul means is an empty one. I took
an unfair advantage of an honorable gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
in the campaign of 1916 and I have always been
sorry and longed to tell you so. I now offer
you my hand. It is the only amendment I can
make for the past."</p>

<p>The apology was a handsome one and Mr.
Cameron was a big enough man to be forgiving.</p>

<p>Taking his enemy's palm in a warm grasp he
said:</p>

<p>"We all blunder sometimes, Carter."</p>

<p>"An honest blunder is one thing; but pre-meditated
meanness is quite another, Cameron.
However, I appreciate your generosity. It is
like you&mdash;on the same scale with the rest of
your nature." Then to shift a subject that
was embarrassing he remarked: "As for these
young rascals of ours, I suppose a great career
awaits each of them after college is over.
Your son has a better brain than mine; but
they are both promising fellows. I'd like to
land Paul in an editorial position. He has a
decided gift for such a job. Perhaps later on
I may be able to help him, should he decide to
take up such work permanently. I should be
very proud to be of service either to you or him,
Cameron."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied Mr. Cameron courteously.</p>

<p>Amid the pressing crowd they separated, the
parents to go home in a mood of satisfaction
and happiness, and the boys to continue the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
day's festivities with a class banquet and a
dance.</p>

<p>That banquet was a never-to-be-forgotten
affair!</p>

<p>For weeks the class officers had been planning
it and no detail was omitted that could add merriment
and joy to the crowning event of 1920's
career.</p>

<p>No sooner were the guests seated at the long
table and the spread fairly begun than a stuffed
rabbit, exquisitely decorated with the class colors,
was borne into the room. This was, of
course, the far-famed March Hare. Its advent
was greeted with a storm of clapping.</p>

<p>Very solemnly it was elevated in Paul's hands
and amid shouts and cheers was carried by the
graduating editor-in-chief to the president of
1921 where, with an appropriate speech, it was
surrendered into the keeping of the incoming
seniors.</p>

<p>Then the banquet went on only to have its
progress interrupted at intervals by bustling
attendants who came rushing in with telegrams,
special delivery letters, and telephone messages
from the Hatter, the Red Queen, the Dormouse,
and many another well-beloved Wonderland
character. Afterward the Walrus and
the Carpenter sang a song and then, with great
acclaim and a crash of the orchestra, the folding
doors opened and Alice herself, impersonating
1921, entered, gathered up the <i>March
Hare</i>, and with a graceful little poem of farewell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to 1920 took the head of the table.</p>

<p>With a sigh glad yet regretful, Paul surrendered
his place.</p>

<p>He had longed for the day when he should be
graduating from school and setting forth for
college; but now that the moment had really
arrived, he found himself not nearly so glad
to depart from the High School as he had expected
to be. Many a pleasant memory clustered
about the four years he had spent in those
familiar classrooms. And the comrades of
those years,&mdash;he was parting from them, too.
Some were scattering to the various colleges;
some were going into business; others were to
remain at home. Never again would they all
travel the same path together. Alas, graduation
had its tragic as well as its happy aspects!</p>

<p>Perhaps some such thought as this lurked
deep down in the breast of every member of
1920, but for the sake of one another, and to
make the last moments they were to spend together
unclouded by sadness, each bravely
struggled to banish this sinister reflection.</p>

<p>Hence the dance that followed the banquet
was an uproarious affair. When one is young
and all the world lies before, the conqueror
Gloom is short-lived. So 1920 danced gayly
until midnight, forgetful of every shadow, and
when weary, sleepy, but triumphant, a half-jubilant,
half-sorrowful lot of girls and boys
betook themselves to their homes, it was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ringing cheers for the Burmingham High
School, the class of 1920, the <i>March Hare</i>, Mr.
Carter, its printer, and Paul Cameron, its editor-in-chief.</p>
